In other words, he refused the return of federal tax dollars paid by Wisconsinites and is actually costing them state tax dollars in the form of the fees the state must pay the insurance companies who administer the Medicaid program.  He also failed to publicize federal court ordered changes in Wisconsin's egregious and unjust voter ID law by not funding the necessary effort to do so, preventing an estimated 300,000 of his citizens from voting.
