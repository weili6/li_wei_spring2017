I'd prefer if schools were serving oatmeal (the \"old-fashioned\" kind, not instant) with some fruit, but I understand that, even though oats in bulk will be less expensive than this company's cereal, it requires cooking (and people to cook it), and cutting fruit into pieces takes preparation as well, so the end result may cost more.

Around the same time, the Republican Party changed its platform policy on the Ukraine, which reeks of a quid pro quo. The only questions are whether it can be proved that the Trump campaign privately coordinated strategy with Russia, paid any of the hackers, and/or received any financial assistance from Russia, and what concessions, in return for this, Trump offered Russia, presumably at the expense of the United States.

Only China has the connections and clout within North Korea to pull that off.  The Chinese have no interest, however, in removing an effective buffer between their territory and the heavy U.S. troop presence in South Korea. The only way to remove this threat to regional and global security, therefore, is to negotiate a Chinese intervention in the North, a mutual guarantee of the security of a neutral and independent South Korea, possibly to be reunited with the North over time coupled with a Chinese withdrawal, and a U.S. withdrawal from the South.
