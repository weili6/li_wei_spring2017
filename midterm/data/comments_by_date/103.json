And maybe with our superior technology we could actually shoot a missile down with laser guided weapons.<br/><br/>But if a nuclear weapon is used against the U.S., it will be delivered in a suitcase or a Chevy van parked in the middle of Times Square, not on the tip of a missile.  No obvious attacker, ergo, no deterrence.  Diplomacy is the only way out of our quandary.  Stop focusing on missile capabilities and start thinking about motives.
