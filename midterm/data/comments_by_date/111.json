I realize I am \"feeding the trolls\" by responding, so I'll keep this short. It was clear Pelosi meant she had never had a 1:1, secretly arranged \"meeting\" (the way Sessions had, and then lied about it under oath); posting a picture where she sat with Russian officials years ago, with numerous other US and foreign diplomats present, on documented and official (and open) business, which she never lied about under oath, is something altogether different.
