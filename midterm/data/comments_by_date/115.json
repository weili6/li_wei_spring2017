And yet it DOES seem that Trump and his pals are top heavy in how many Russians they are talking to and that despite claims to the contrary Trump HAS business dealings with Russians that we are only getting a glimpse of.<br/>It is up to Trump to put this to an end if he wants to stop the 'witch hunt'. And I don't mean by quashing any and all investigations. He and his cronies can open up about business as usual dealings and he can show us he has no financial interests or else he only has himself to blame if speculation swirls and information is dug up.

In Cambridge, Washington and New York, there are social occasions, cultural programs, academic conferences, political and trade conventions attended by high-level executives from the U.S., Russia, and elsewhere.  <br/><br/>Such contacts are entirely understandable and routine exchanges.  Unfortunately, Trump's denials bring to mind \"the lady doth protest too much, methinks.\"  The fact that Trump is blowing an increasingly dense smoke screen raises questions.  <br/><br/>All things considered, it is highly likely that Trump has Russia-related vulnerabilities.  We can assume, for example, that Russian intelligence has compromising videos of Trump cavorting with Russian prostitutes.  (We know that Trump, by his own admission, can't keep his trousers zipped.)<br/><br/>We can further assume that Russian money has propped up Trump's shaky business deals.  Trump's refusal to release tax returns raises further questions.  U.S. intelligence reports that Russian influence played a role in the 2016 presidential election<br/><br/>In any matters involving Russia which come before the Trump administration, we are concerned that \"President\" Trump will do all he can to affect a favorable outcome for Russian interests.
