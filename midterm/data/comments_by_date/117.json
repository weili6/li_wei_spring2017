His approval ratings have suffered since his abysmal attempt to capture the GOP nomination and now he is attempting to resurrect his image as Mr Conservative through cheap App-eds and throwing a few bucks at Education in WI. In short, he's a third rate political hack with big dollar backers controlling his every move. Maybe he should take a look at the Democratic governor of Minnesota - that state is in a lot better shape than Wisconsin.
