On the other hand, China and South Korea enjoy a friendly relationship, and without a threat from North Korea, the South would probably be very happy to stay non-aligned between the US and China. China would in turn gain an economically (if not politically) stable neighbor that was still not allied with the US.<br/><br/>In short, if you remove North Korea as a basis for needing a large US military presence in the South, our troops can come home, China gets a peaceful neighbor, and you remove a major nuclear threat from the world.  Trump is The Great Dealmaker, and he is also looking for ways to reduce expenditures on alliances while increasing US security.  So let's start thinking outside of the box we have been trapped in for the past 60+ years and make a deal, already.
