In one of the first years funds were dispersed, the biggest single windfall, $650,000, if I remember correctly, went to a strictly Muslim school.  The school is located in a community-wide Muslim center and its \"curriculum\", according to its poorly updated website, includes direct instruction of the Quran.  I had to do a bit of research to discover this, so It's probably a safe bet that the general public has no idea that this is where their taxes dollars are going.   In the interest of fairness, it's also probably a safe bet that Christian schools (which make up about 90% of the voucher recipients in NC) are providing direct instruction in the Bible.  While they probably cringe when handing over money to a Muslim school, they are not stupid enough to deny funding to a particular faith for fear that potential discrimination lawsuits would blow their scam wide open and the public might learn what really goes on.
