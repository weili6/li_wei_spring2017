Oh my!  I guess integrity doesn't mean anything unless it's the opposing party, right?  And Deborah, if you don't understand the relationship between illegal immigration lowering wages and reducing job opportunities for entry-level job seekers, and lower skills citizen candidates, you aren't paying attention or you deliberately ignore the data.<br/><br/>My point is if you want ethics purity, police your own, first.  Hillary, the DNC and their collusions with mainstream media were sickening and turned people to vote for someone who wasn't so corrupt.  Bernie was an option, but those parties made sure he didn't win the nomination.  So now you're complaining about Trump being elected and trying to destroy his legitimacy by any means necessary.  What hypocrisy.  Democrats have nothing to offer the American people, since they prioritized illegals over citizens and legal immigrants, and identity groups over America the whole.  <br/><br/>I'm not saying the Republicans are perfect either.  But Trump and his team have a plan.  And part of that plan is enforcing immigration law.

What has been so troubling from Republicans, including Trump, who challenged the majority of America who is horrified by his agenda, to set aside \u201ctrivial fights\u201d \u2013 as if life/death health care is \u201ctrivial\u201d, or shutting down climate action and diplomacy in favor of \u201chistoric\u201d expansion of military hardware \u2013 is that Republicans never have any intention of trying to accommodate the objections. Throughout the Obama Administration and now, Republicans idea of \u201cunity\u201d is \u201cdo what we say or we will crush you.\u201d Obama desperately tried to bring Republicans into the health care discussion \u2013 remember that U-shaped table discussion where Obama sat for hours pleading to hear other ideas \u2013 and as for \u201cstate\u2019s rights\u201d as Walker asserts is the be-all-and-end-all, the Affordable Care Act (as well as the Clean Energy Plan) allowed for states to come up with their own solutions as long as they met minimal criteria. But as for state control of such vital things as health care, that sets up a situation of unequal protection among Americans based on zipcode.", "userDisplayName": "KR", "assetID": 3466322, "recommendationCount": 4, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 33270994, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1416, "createDate": "1488640976", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/against-protests-republicans-must-stand-strong.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21684940, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488641151", "approveDate": "1488641151", "parentID": null, "rgt": 1419, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Montville, NJ", "commentSequence": 21684940, "commentBody": "I am reminded of the Mel Brooks dialog : <br/><br/>Advisor : \"The people are revolting!\"<br/>King : \"Yes they are!\"<br/><br/>Mr. Walker finds demovracy and public protest so annoying and wonders why he can use troops to sweep them away.", "userDisplayName": "Just Thinking", "assetID": 3466322, "recommendationCount": 7, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 63317610, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1418, "createDate": "1488640982", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/against-protests-republicans-must-stand-strong.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21684942, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488641151", "approveDate": "1488641151", "parentID": null, "rgt": 1421, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Barcelona", "commentSequence": 21684942, "commentBody": "Governor Walker does not stipulate that returning authority to the states is an empty gesture, unless the Federal Government also returns the funds we send to Washington to pay for governance.
