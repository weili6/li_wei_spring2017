Why shouldn't I be bitter and angry?\"<br/>~ JULIE NICHOLSON, English vicar whose daughter, Jenny, died in the London tube bombings of July 2005.<br/><br/>* Do note that i saw it as MY duty to not vote for one of two scoundrels and abstained.  It was my 'sacrifice' since I will have ceased to be a US citizen by the next presidential election and without regret will not qualify to vote.", "userDisplayName": "Robert Coane", "assetID": 3466322, "recommendationCount": 1, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 30197783, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1544, "createDate": "1488641810", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/against-protests-republicans-must-stand-strong.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21685175, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488641923", "approveDate": "1488641923", "parentID": 21684490, "rgt": 1372, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "commentSequence": 21685175, "commentBody": "So what you're saying is that New Yorkers can't govern themselves because corruption is endemic in your society?

The rank hypocrisy compared to their behavior during the Obama administration has now become so routine that the public ignores it. But the illegality that is yet before us is the most worrisome in our entire national history. <br/><br/>Sessions is the enabler. Lying, cheating, polluting, discrimination--all currently illegal--are now easily managed by passing legislation legalizing them. What can't be managed in law will be managed by simply not prosecuting this behavior. The public can try the courts, but this will be a frustrating exercise when the DOJ frustrates every effort to enforce the rule of law. <br/><br/>And it is deeply ironic that Sessions, who as AG is the enforcer of the rule of law seems to have no intention to do that--starting with his own behavior.

In other words, he is the president of the Russian people - their choice. He has not engaged in any pogroms or any activities usually associated with dictators. Further, Russia is an ally of the United States. It wasn't during the Cold War, but it is now. Russia is no threat to the United States. They are not a Caliphate seeking to rule the world. They have not threatened war against us, beheaded any of our citizens, or gunned down innocent Americans in California or Florida. <br/><br/>Finally, all this stuff about Putin and alleged hacking of Mrs. Clinton's e-mails to \"steer\" the election is nothing more than a continuation of pre-election partisan hype. There is no proof of it at all, and there is nothing sinister about any American who might talk to a Russian. And it's kind of funny for some so-called \"Progressives,\" who regularly claim to only deal in facts to now accept innuendo, suspecions, and allegations as the basis of this continuing smear campaign against President Trump and President Putin.
