Taxis aren't perfect either but at least they screen their drivers more.<br/><br/>On the taxi side, many companies need to improve their customer service. In some cities, especially smaller ones with few taxi/ public transport options, the dispatcher is rude, rides are late if they arrive at all, and the cabs can be very dirty.

The services should be regulated and the drivers should be vetted by some municipal authority and the regulating agencies should be funded by fees from the ride services.
