Their suffering has been for naught because there was no light at the end of the tunnel. Our country and each state is a community where we all live together, work together and succeed together.

Our excellent University of Wisconsin system has slipped in national ratings due to cut funding, tuition freezes, and exiting faculty (again, low morale), who take their research funding with them. Programs that study climate change, green farming practices, and protections of our natural resources have seen cuts.
