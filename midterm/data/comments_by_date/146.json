Hopefully no wrong doing occurred in investigating the Trump campaign.<br/><br/>If I understand correctly, unless there was a special warrant, it would be unlawful to identify the content related Flynn, a U. S. citizen.  If general wiretapping was done on the Trump administration, wouldn't that be a crime unless there was a Forth Amendment compliant warrant based on probably cause, and an oath of affirmation, specifically identifying the scope of the surveillance.  The Forth should clearly prevent spying on the next administration for politically purposes.. <br/><br/>I hope the Obama administration did not illegally spy on the incoming Trump administration.
