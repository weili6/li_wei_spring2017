Because of our acceptance of electronics that is susceptible to EMP, most of our civilization would grind to a halt in such an attack.<br/><br/>This is different from a full scale nuclear attack in that it requires far fewer warheads which can be launched anonymously at sea from third party container ships which is well within North Korea's capabilities today.
