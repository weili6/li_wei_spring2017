The braggadocio in proceeding with the evisceration of safeguards, regulations and the agencies charged with enforcement will damage us all for generations is breath-taking (literally), while the hubris of claiming a mandate with the diversion of \"fake news\", \"alternative facts\", \"phantom alien voters who all voted for Hillary\", \"Obama wire taps, coup plotters and compliant allies\" reflects a systemic illness (and probably a physical one) that needs lots of treatment.<br/>The Watergate flashbacks are so surreal, and it seems the question is not \"What did the president know and when did he know it\" but more like \"How long has the president been compromised and how many of his coterie involved?\"<br/>The GOP Congress has to decide if they want to put the country's best interest over party politics and the diversions underway by Trump, Bannon and company. The republic's fate is in their hands. ", "userDisplayName": "B.
