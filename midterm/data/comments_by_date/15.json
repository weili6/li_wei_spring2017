It lists every alleged contact between the Trump campaign and Russia. It equates wild unverifiable allegations with facts documented by the FBI and the CIA.<br/>Patience and hard work are virtues. There are well documented private contacts by General Flynn and Senator Sessions, during the campaign with Russia. Some of these contacts were with members of Russian intelligence (Russian intelligence during a Presidential campaign??). Both Flynn and Sessions also misled Congress and Vice President Pence. Sessions even falsely testified that he had no such private contacts with the Russian ambassador i<br/>When Sessions finally admitted that he had met privately with the Russian ambassador in his office just days before Russia dumped thousands of emails that Russia had criminally stolen from Democratic Headquarters, he refused to deny that the presidential campaign was not discussed. Instead Sessions said, \"Ambassadors are chatty.\" But I don't recall any such conversations. Sessions also failed to explain why the Russian Ambassador took the unheard of step of meeting privately with Sessions in his office when the Russian Ambassador universally telephones calls other Senators.<br/>These two incidence are the veins that will lead to the mother lode.
