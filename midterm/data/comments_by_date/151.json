They play chess, the left plays checkers.  They left nows plays chess, but the opposition is playing Go.  At one time merely a day late and a dollar short, the unhinged left and their puppy - the once potent democratic party - are left to scream redfaced as the business of a total repudiation of DC governance extant continues.  What is not understood is that in continuous attacks on everything and everyone the goal of this administration is brought closer to realization in that the organs of the deep state and its visible entities are now forever in the political realm.  This means any administration could operate unfettered by the permanent government so long as they control Congress.  Like now.  The other side of the coin is that without controlling Congress, which would be what the next liberal in the white house will face, no deep state well of support will be available to circumvent a hostile Legislature.  Now that \"war\" has been declared, this administration will seek, find and uproot all vestiges of the liberal bureaucracy.  By not prmitting any attempt at sensible governing, the left energizes those intent on a total dismantling.  And they are only too happy to oblige.  Once more, the tactics of the democrats will bring about the exact opposite of their desires.
