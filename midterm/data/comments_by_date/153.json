FDR's Democratic party had 2/3 or higher Congressional majorities for his first 2 terms which began the vast expansion of the federal government that is still decried by the Repubs.  The judiciary was the only check on FDR's power, and he tried to eliminate that one via his court packing scheme.  Looming and actual war got him reelected the 3rd and 4th times and the war was arguably what ended the Great Depression.  Trump's Congressional majorities are much narrower and far more internally fractious which, in effect, will at least delay and probably deny much of the Republican social agenda but the 1% and corporate America will likely get their tax cuts and reforms.  The Roberts Supreme Court will not be a pushover either, particularly since Trump has been pillorying the judiciary but, on the other hand, it looks like Kellyanne's husband George, who clerked for Scalia and won the Paula Jones case, will be Solicitor General once Trump gets around to nominating someone.

He is under siege because so many of his aides and associates have been shown to have met secretly with the Russian ambassador, and several have lied about it, Trump responds by tweeting out photos of Pelosi and Schumer meeting with Putin, and tweets that the Russian ambassador visited Obama's White House 22 times.<br/><br/>This deflection - defending by attacking - overlooks several key points. First, it isn't the meetings that are the problem, it's the subject of discussion at the meetings. Pelosi and Schumer met with Putin out in the open - otherwise Trump wouldn't have photos of the meetings to tweet out. <br/><br/>Second, it is precisely the job of the White House to meet with foreign ambassadors. The whole reason that countries have ambassadors is to meet with the governments they are ambassadors to.<br/><br/>And third, Jeff Sessions, Carter Page and Michael Flynn all got in trouble not because they met with the Russian ambassador, but because they lied about it. Neither Pelosi, Schumer nor the Obama White House has ever denied that they met with Putin or the Russian ambassador.<br/><br/>But many people, when they hear about Trump's accusatory tweets, is that  Democrats are hypocrites because they also met with Russians. Trump is not stupid; he knows that's not the issue. He is intentionally obfuscating the issue, and he is having remarkable success with the tactic.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com\" title=\"politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com\" target=\"_blank\">politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com</a>", "userDisplayName": "Ecce Homo", "assetID": 3466310, "recommendationCount": 16, "status": "approved", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21686301, "commentSequence": 21686301, "editorsSelection": false, "updateDate": "1488649416", "depth": 1, "approveDate": "1488649416", "userURL": "NULL", "parentID": 21685443, "createDate": "1488647774", "parentUserDisplayName": "Ecce Homo", "recommendations": 0, "commentBody": "Calling people hypocrites is a pretty standard political attack.
