We have yet to hear a justification for why those who do essential work for the state should be martyrs to the cause of conservative tax policy. Is the education of our future work force so worthless to conservatives? The irony is that the Republican's flimsy grasp of free market capitalism is going to come back to bite. Application rates at education preparation programs across the nation are down 50% because college students know it's a raw deal: non-competitive wages, poor working conditions, no respect, and now, eroding benefits. Supply and demand applies to human capital as well - if you're paying like the work isn't in-demand, you aren't going to get quality applicants. The scariest thought is that this may be intentional - illiterate voters are the easiest to control.

Many \"candidate coffees\" were held at my house growing up - my family was quite entrenched in Ohio politics.  Debate on issues was welcomed because screaming matches were considered unthinkable.  Candidates listened to their constituents' concerns or objections and honestly attempted to sort it all out and do what was best for the whole of their district.

There is little thought to consequences for the whole of society.  If I disagree with an opinion, I will jump on social media, whip up a like-minded group and go shout down anyone's opposing opinion.

Governor Walker did not campaign on the issues that became his signature piece of legislation, Act 10, which increased the share of health insurance and retirement benefit contributions to be made by teachers, while at the same time stripping them of their collect bargaining rights concerning these issues, causing their take home pay to decrease by over 10%.   Not surprisingly, many experienced teacher left early.  Police and public safety unions, which had supported Walker, were not affected in the same ways, however.   Wisconsin may have balanced its budget, but it has done so by neglecting its public schools, infrastructure, state university system and state parks.<br/><br/>While not even \"liberals\" condone death threats, the massive protests in Madison, Wisconsin were not the result of liberal opposition to \"big government,\" but to the complete surprise of Act 10's taking away teachers\u2019 collective bargaining rights on economic issues.  This sort of \"bait and switch\" form of governance is the norm for Governor Walker. In his campaign for re-election, when asked about so-called \"right to work\" laws, he told voters it was not a high priority for him. As soon as he was re-elected, the Republican majority in the Wisconsin legislature sent him just such a bill, which he promptly signed, making Wisconsin a, \"right to work,\" state.
