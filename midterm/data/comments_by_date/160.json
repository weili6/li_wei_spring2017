Such a service could have worked if the drivers were charged a monthly fee to have a listing. Then all they created was a service and how people use it is not on them. Instead, they created a business model in which they are the gatekeepers between the driver with the car and the rider customer. Yet they want none of the responsibility that comes with that position, but ALL of the profits. Uber is a reflection of the person who created it, zero integrity and zero respect for laws.
