Kim Jong-un must have a clear idea of what he is getting into.  He may get one off, but he should understand that his nation would be vaporized.  Is it world understanding that North Korea would undergo a blistering nuclear counterattack if North Korea used nuclear weapons?<br/><br/>Having a no-holds barred nuclear response to North Korean nuclear aggression should be an absolutely transparent policy to the world.
