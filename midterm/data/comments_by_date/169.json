I remember the Johnson administration had been making a big deal for years that the war was all about getting S. Vietnam to have elections and now they had and wasn't that just great. We were there to protect democracy. Being young and naive, I bought that. I also remember the next spring ('68) reading a little tiny blurb in the newspaper just casually mentioning that Thieu had arrested and jailed the guy who came in 2nd in the election (running on a peace platform of negotiating w the VC) on what even then struck me as a trumped up charge.<br/>The opponent was Truong Dinh Dzu (here's a notice of his sentencing in Sept <a href=\"http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/09/16/page/21/article/viet-runner-up-gets-prison-in-money-case\" title=\"http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/09/16/page/21/article/viet-runner-up-gets-prison-in-money-case\" target=\"_blank\">http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/09/16/page/21/article/viet-runne...</a> but he was arrested in May)<br/>To me at the time, that was as if Johnson had had Goldwater arrested after the '64 election. It opened my eyes for the first time to the snake oil we were being sold (and have been ever since) that American intervention was all about protecting democracy. Thieu was no more a democrat (little d) than Ho Chi Minh---probably less so. Yet 10s of thousands of Americans and millions of SE Asians died to put him, and men like him, in power.
