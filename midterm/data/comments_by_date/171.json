The Pope after all is just a human surrounded by enormous wealth, has not forgotten his humble roots as a priest. I'm agnostic and have no right to stand in judgment of the human foibles of how our life's condition turns out. The loose change or crinkled dollar will not buy me a ticket to the world beyond but it will at least in that moment of exchange with another human connect our shared humanity.
