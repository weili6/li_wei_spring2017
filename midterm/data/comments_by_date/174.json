Walker argues for a return to the Article of Confederation. A time in American history when a weak central government failed to unify the states securely. We forget that the period of Mar 1, 1781, to Sept 13, 1788, was one of turmoil and enmity between our citizens.<br/><br/>Our first experiment in self-governance failed because states would act without consideration of the United States and this undermined our new union's ability to be unified in trade and international treaties. Each state set up economic interests in competition with other states. Our government money became the subject of the popular derision, \"not worth a Continental.\" Interstate commerce failed in the absence of a strong central government.<br/><br/>Gov. Walker and his GOP brethren yearn for a return to days of anti-Federalism. They look forward to destroying our Constitution and the establishment of unified policy among our states. One that was novel in history, as Madison presented in Federalist 39: \"The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states.
