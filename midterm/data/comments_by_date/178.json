They were focuses on preparing and transporting the rice crop to market each year without getting caught in the crossfire between the Viet Cong/NVA and the Saigon government. <br/><br/>I'll give you an example: In the second half of my tour, in 1969, Thieu paid a visit to Cao Lanh, which was (and remains, albeit under a different name) the provincial capital. We were at first puzzled by the number deuce-and-a-half army trucks thundering into the countryside and into the hamlets. Then we realized they were loading the villagers onto the trucks (not voluntarily) and transporting them into town. They were handed national flags, and then martialed into lines along the city streets by officers in shades screaming into bullhorns. Thieu arrived by chopper and they waved their flags as he proceeded to  the province chief's palace. They disbursed after he left a couple,of hours later.<br/><br/>We watched this entire charade from our jeep, shaking our heads. Later on I asked a young woman who worked in our compound what she thought of President Thieu. I don't know who that is, she said. Your president? You don't know your president? I then asked, what about Nguyen Cao Ky? Oh yes, she said, and she produced a comic book from her satchel. It was a story about the dashing Ky and his glamorous wife, fighting the Commies and making Vietnam safe for democracy.<br/><br/>So much for the Saigon government.", "userDisplayName": "Mike Vouri", "assetID": 3466323, "recommendationCount": 26, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 38276785, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 102, "createDate": "1488648422", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/the-feud-that-sank-saigon.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21686441, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488649349", "approveDate": "1488649349", "parentID": null, "rgt": 105, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Coronado, CA", "commentSequence": 21686441, "commentBody": "For a short period of time in the early 2000s, I became acquainted with General and Mrs. Ky.
