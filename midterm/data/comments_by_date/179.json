There seems to be no news, news lately. I spend an inordinate amount of time in the last year reading both the \"hard copy\" and online versions of the New York Times and am an avid follower of MSNBC. However, lately the major portion of the news seems to be donald trump. I personally do not subject myself to listening nor viewing Mr. Trump.<br/>Could we get back to the \"real\" news now?
