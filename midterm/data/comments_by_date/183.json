Despite the personal financial advantage they offer, I refuse to use them because their business model is nothing more than patent exploitation masquerading as some sort of progressive \"new economy\" industry.<br/><br/>Uber lines its pockets with the labor of drivers who are desperate to make ends meet and are thus willing to use their own capital investment (their cars) and pay for the costs of maintaining those capital investments, while getting subpar wages and receiving no benefits or labor protections from Uber.<br/><br/>Hypocritical upper middle class liberals talk the I-hate-Uber talk but won't walk the walk because -- in contrast to when they're at home watching Bill Mahr on TV -- when they're on the street their self-interest easily outweighs their politics.<br/><br/>Transportation is regulated by local, state and federal government for myriad reasons related to safety and efficient use of pubic resources.  The fact that the project of regulating transportation services is not well executed by government, or that profit margins in the taxi business in any particular locale do not permit the provision of service as comfortable as that offered by Uber is not, in my view, a reason to embrace Uber's exploitation.  <br/><br/>Put another way, if we legalized slavery for purposes of the taxi business, I'm sure I could provide taxi service that would be half the cost of Uber's and twice as nice in amenities.", "userDisplayName": "DD", "assetID": 3466321, "recommendationCount": 7, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 33608861, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1422, "createDate": "1488650604", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21686271, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488651961", "approveDate": "1488651961", "parentID": 21677943, "rgt": 488, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Everytown USA", "commentSequence": 21686271, "commentBody": "My 65 year old brother's life was ruined by Uber.  40 years ago he purchased  a medallion in Boston, risked his life driving for years, paid the City annual fees, bought an expensive Prius the City required, and followed the City's other expensive rules and regulations.

I came in the Navy as an ensign in 1986 and over the course of a 26 career saw little real change in the standoff/stalemate with NK. Despite the massive investments the U.S. made to neutralize the threat (we spent nearly $1B on a single mobile missile defense ship that is being mothballed, eg), NK has managed to stay level with us though having no where near the level of resources we do....just by making threats. <br/><br/>Trump--for obvious reasons--has the opportunity to shun convention and take a radically different approach.  Not sure what that will be but wouldn't surprise me if he baits NK into doing something that elicits an overwhelming, multi-lateral kinetic response. In then end I think if you make it clear to NK that you are willing to \"take their best shot\"--and that life as they know it will end for good shortly thereafter--they will cave. But you gotta be willing to take a punch...something no administration has seriously considered in my lifetime.  Not saying there's not significant risk there...NK could actually land at least a glancing blow if they get lucky.
