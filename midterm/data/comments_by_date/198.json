The great players are all professionals who play in the major leagues and must prepare themselves for the regular season of 162 games. This is what they get paid for this is what they have trained for their entire lives.<br/><br/>Ball players are not in shape before spring training and they are too exhausted after the regular season to play  in another round of baseball games.  That leaves no time period for which the WBC to take place.<br/><br/>All of the best players from all of the countries in the world already happen to play in the major leagues with the exception of an occasional Korean or Mexican or Japanese player or Cuban.  And we can expect to see more of those players from those countries in the major-league soon.  The thought of having Gary Sanchez or Noah Syndergaard or Mike Trout seriously injured in the WBC is abhorrent to even the casual fan.<br/><br/>That leaves the WBC as a sideshow populated by retreads, players long past their prime,  and mediocre players like Ike Davis playing for the Israeli team. That may make for cute stories in the news about Mike Piazza 'S roots  in Italy. <br/><br/>The WBC, along with Esperanto, Olympic Golf, and the XFL is a misbegotten mistake.
