Every major news organization is open to leaks, and they are leading in lots of directions. The undeniable fact is; There is a web of links between Trump and his crew and a variety of Russians. Diplomats, oligarchs, businessmen. Spies or not? It's my guess that if Putin wants information from any of these contacts, he will get it.<br/><br/>MSNBC also ran clips of Trump alternately claiming to have a relationship with Mr. Putin, and to have never met or talked to him. As with most things about Trump, the truth is what he wants it to be at any moment--- he has fungible facts.  This is where a free press comes in.
