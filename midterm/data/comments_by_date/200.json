A few months before she died we were lying in bed together and she turned to me and proclaimed \"I've decided who you should connect with after I die\".  I have to admit that it was one of the most surprising conversations I have ever had, and one I was extremely uncomfortable having, or even listening to, and I shut it down quickly because I didn't want to even consider a time when Kathy would not be part of my life.

Her writing looks for the meaning of life through personal thoughts and the pondering of the everyday. She turns the mundane into essentials, the trivial into necessities and most of all her curiosity into love. Now, she does so with such honesty it's beyond moving and I want to thank her for searching for the mysteries of life and trying to decipher them right here in our own laps.  Love to her family, Chicago and everyone that is lucky enough to be close to her. Read and buy her books for your children, for your friends and family and most of all for yourself.", "userDisplayName": "Lois Keller", "assetID": 3466311, "recommendationCount": 5, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 73313502, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1744, "createDate": "1488637946", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21686844, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488656287", "approveDate": "1488656287", "parentID": null, "rgt": 117, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Texas", "commentSequence": 21686844, "commentBody": "Loved this puzzle!

Some wants more and still gets what he or she'd always wanted. A few will get to live \"forever in happiness.\" For most, and it's a silent majority \"most,\" true love is not a success story, but of happiness, of meaning, of \"the Road Less Taken.\" The former (success) is defined as getting what you'd always wanted, and for love, to have it \"forever.\" Yet, the most touching stories of true love is epitomized by this journey of Amy and Jason. 26 years has felt like \"forever\" in your heart, where time is not 24 hours, but each second with the person of affection felt like a nano-second and each nano-second without the each other felt like a decade. Happiness is defined as appreciating what you have and you certainly shared that with us. In the human kingdom, Love is more than just caring. The heart is able to leap beyond the realm of just \"caring,\" which most animals automatically do for each other. The human heart can make sacrifices for the future of other loved ones, for we define love as how we vision it in the context of others. This is similar to Randy Pausch's \"My Last Lecture,\" initially written to scribe a father's to-be-taught lessons of life for his children, to Steve Jobs' admission to Bill Gates that the computer they invented have not much improved education at his death bed (Bill's mother was a teacher), to the Love Story's famous line \"Never Having to Say You're Sorry.\" It's not easy to say true love is about also letting the other person go.", "userDisplayName": "Nguyen", "assetID": 3466311, "recommendationCount": 1, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 46150933, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1750, "createDate": "1488642253", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21685837, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488656317", "approveDate": "1488656317", "parentID": 21682863, "rgt": 1634, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Sunnyvale CA", "commentSequence": 21685837, "commentBody": "The miracle is the love she has experienced.
