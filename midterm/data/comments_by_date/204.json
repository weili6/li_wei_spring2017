Here's my advice:  when you're starting out in life in your 20s or 30s, take a look around you.  Who are the important people in your life?  Why?  Are they older?  Are they retired?  Who do you respect and marvel at?  Who makes you laugh?  Who loves life and stays positive day after day, even on the dark days.  And how do they do that.  After giving this some considerable thought, create an amalgam and make that your vision.  My grandmother lived every day like it was her last.  She had an unmatched joie de vivre.  She is an important component of my vision.  One day someone told me that they envy me because I have such joie de vivre.  I thanked them, but then I quietly thanked my grandmother who passed away a few years before when she was 100.  If someone tells me I possess those qualities, then I consider myself fortunate, not successful because that implies a destination.
