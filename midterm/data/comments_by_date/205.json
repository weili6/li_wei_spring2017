Now. We tried to change the world, but failed to undo the mess we were left by the \"greatest\" generation. Stay on top of what laws are passed and who gets into office. They are threatening to gut the social safety net and our healthcare costs are already obscene, which matters greatly as you age. And I know everyone will tell you to scrimp and save. My husband and I did that. The \"great recession\" hit and we were laid off in our late 50s. Then he developed a brain tumor suddenly and dies within a year ... costing us half of what was left of our savings. Our culture doesn't value age and treats older people as so much nuisance instead of recognizing that we don't become raging useless idiots because we are over 50. YOU will eventually be over 50. You may become \"un-hireable\" and have to scramble financially. Make sure you elect leaders who will pass laws that help you and your families through the worst of times. That's what all those taxes you're paying in throughout your younger years are supposed to go toward. Don't give in to the illusion that YOU will be different ... you won't hit bad times, you won't need help, you are prepared. Remember, not everyone suffering through having to work into their 70s or live in squalor squandered their money or made bad decisions. Our circumstances are greatly affected by those in power.
