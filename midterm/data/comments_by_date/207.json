But there is no need for a famine caused by government and rebel troops appropriating humanitarian supplies, this is disgusting and shows that the military and any solution involving supporting military action is counterproductive. The thing that gets me is that history just repeats itself; I remember reading how Machar as a warlord used to misappropriate supplies to feed and his rebels. You would think that at the very least there could be some from the international community just on this level, forget about having a trustee government or some such thing -- just protection of the donated supplies and ensuring that they get to the people they are intended to go to.", "userDisplayName": "DS", "assetID": 3466333, "recommendationCount": 2, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 46179048, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 114, "createDate": "1488648910", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/world/africa/war-south-sudan.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21686480, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488660980", "approveDate": "1488660980", "parentID": null, "rgt": 117, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Pasadena, Ca", "commentSequence": 21686480, "commentBody": "By all rights we should have nothing to complain about here or elsewhere, after reading this, but yet we will.
