We now know due to high level leaks to the media, that the NSA had monitored these phone calls that not so coincidentally occurred on the same day that then President Obama has expelled Russians for spying.  The intelligence leaks gave privy to the public that General Flynn was not being forthright (similarly to Jess Sessions) about the extent of his ill timed phone calls to known Russian spy, Kislyak.   Flynn had lied to the American public as well as ostensibly to VP Pence making it seem as if the phone calls were not attempts to assuage Russian anger &amp; to curry favor while at the same time undermining President Obama's foreign policy which many would suggest was treasonous secretive behavior.  The public now knows, thanks to White House or Intelligence leaks, that Trump's son-in-law with General Flynn had private talks with the same Russian diplomat that Flynn &amp; Sessions lied about to the American public.
