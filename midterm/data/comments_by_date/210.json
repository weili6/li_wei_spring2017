I spoke with her separately, she stopped, and now several years later they have a good relationship.  Bottom line, a child has the same right as an adult to set limits regarding physical boundaries and to decide when an activity stops being fun.  The father needs to understand that if his child is saying \"no\" the appropriate reaction is to pause and ask her if she would prefer to stop, or if she really wants to continue, and then proceed based solely on her verbalized preference, not his.
