If anything, there should be more oversight and companies such as Uber rather than less even if some mention that it's a form of communism.  Unfortunately, those opposed to having more oversight don't know that it gets businesses to follow the rules more fairly rather than trying to cheat on them.  For the record, I'm not against the free market or competition, I'm against those who don't like to play by rules.  Keep in mind that the actual taxi companies and other official car services have to be subject to numerous rules and regulations while those such as Uber and Lyft believe that they are above the laws and can do whatever they want to without feeling hindered by it.  There has even been found evidence that Uber does have a history of treating both their drivers and passengers badly by saying that some of their drivers are just contractors in that they don't have to pay them a living wage while there have been passengers forced to pay even more to ride Uber than what a normal taxi or car service charges.  I won't be surprised if they used the Greyball to hide many vehicles they have on the streets.  At least the TLC doesn't try to hide anything let alone condone bad drivers.  One other thing, the TLC has to pay a lot for medallions just to stay afloat while services such as Uber and Lyft pay next to nothing for that.", "userDisplayName": "Tal Barzilai", "assetID": 3466321, "recommendationCount": 5, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 8535049, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1580, "createDate": "1488659100", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21687038, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488662368", "approveDate": "1488662368", "parentID": null, "rgt": 1583, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "NYC", "commentSequence": 21687038, "commentBody": "Uber and the other 'new' corporations promote the 'Gig Economy' - work for yourself without benefits - at the same time they are working feverishly to replace their drivers with driverless vehicles.
