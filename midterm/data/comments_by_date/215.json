But when is our seditious Congress going to step up and protect this nation - and it's reputation - from our deluded, fantasy driven Liar-In-Chief?<br/><br/>\"Calvin and Hobbes\" was a look into the imagination fueled, zany world of a six year old, self-centered wild child. How is it that 30 years later, it's become a roadmap on how to find a saner, more mature model of our President and Commander-In-Chief? Add to this, the growing, substantial pile of evidence indicating that Trump is functionally illiterate - which is why he will not do many briefings - and we have what amounts to a critical, ongoing national emergency.<br/><br/>Make that a world emergency... The man has his finger on the nation's nuclear trigger, and is ultimate Commander of the world's largest military. What happens if he decides to distract everyone from Russia by nuking North Korea? Why is it OK that this continue?", "userDisplayName": "GWBear", "assetID": 3466349, "recommendationCount": 214, "status": "approved", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21688060, "commentSequence": 21688060, "editorsSelection": false, "updateDate": "1488668978", "depth": 1, "approveDate": "1488668978", "userURL": "NULL", "parentID": 21687267, "createDate": "1488666974", "parentUserDisplayName": "GWBear", "recommendations": 11, "commentBody": "Yes and he believes Breitbart and Faux News because the intelligence agencies like the NSA, CIA and FBI are all liars.

Dick.  He did very little research on the birth of Christianity, basing most of his opinions on a relatively unknown, salacious, book on Christianity written 19th century.  He is so arrogant as to tell us what was Saint Luke thinking and why the Magnificat is an invention and so offensive as to claim that the Virgin Mary masturbated herself.  How does he know? Any evidence, even indirect?  His evidence seems to come from his admitted love of masturbating while watching pornographic movies.<br/>It is not that he \"reinvented nonfiction.....\u201d, \"blends personal history, reportage, philosophy and theology\" as the author says, but that he produces a hodge-podge of anything that comes to his mind.
