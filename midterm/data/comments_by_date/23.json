I believe in conservatism as a viable and necessary force to counter the excesses of liberalism-just as liberalism is a necessary force for countering the excesses of conservatism.

As long as Trump declared that he was a Republican, he was \"conservative.\" Not one Republican politician has unequivocally criticized President Trump. Rather, it is simply about closing ranks around the golden boy. The tragedy of the American two-party system is that naked partisanship and foolishness has been allowed to overtake integrity, objectivity and the very role Congress is supposed to play against the executive. Congress is supposed to check the executive, not let it run amok. That is an objective fact. Democrats must be more fervent in holding Trump's feet to the fire. Republicans, meanwhile, must step back from the spoils of their poisoned victory and assess Trump objectively and whether he is holding to conservative principles. I do not care whether a conservative or a liberal sits in the White House so long as congress ensures that the executive is working within its legal bounds. There is a good case to be made that Trump has overstepped those bounds.

Ultimate, individual state power was tried through the Continental Congress, which saw 13 former colonies that could not agree on anything, including national defense. That's why a second constitutional convention was called in Philadelphia in 1787: they knew they needed a national government, one that could supersede the squabbling of the individual states, which established 13 individual currencies and charged duties on \"imported\" goods crossing state lines. It was chaos. (There are many histories detailing these facts, one recent one being Carol Berkin's excellent book \"The Bill of Rights\").<br/><br/>States do not enjoy the flexibility of the national government in times of crisis or recession. Many are required to report balanced budgets, which means when the needs of citizens rise most intensely, the states have to slam the door in the faces of those most in need. The national economy, and federal budget, help to balance the various state and regional economies so that, to an important degree, no state is left dangling in the wind with extreme poverty and dire infrastructure needs unaddressed.<br/><br/>\"Returning power to the states\" is just another Republican argument for doing less. Scott Walker and many others lack the courage to stand up and say what they want, but what they really mean to do is cripple the federal power to override local, self centered stinginess.

Furthermore, the right kind of investments can have a larger multiplier effect on the economy whereas cutting back, disinvestment, multiplies very little or nothing at all.<br/><br/>There are many signs (look at Kansas, Louisiana and others) that the tax cutting philosophy of Republicans, which is supposed to offer more jobs, does not work. The argument of Walker and his ilk seems to be derived, first and foremost, to be based on a desire to cut taxes on the richest constituents as a first case and then to find an excuse to believe that better results will come about for all.
