I am not in any way saying that russian interference and possible collusion isn't important, rather if he cared about protecting our country and the threats against it, he would put the matter to bed by releasing his tax returns and/or invite an independent commission to investigate it. We need an active POTUS and right now we have one that is distracted, stalled, and unprepared. Trump supporters you should care about this and demand it from your president.

For Kim Jong-un and his coterie, a nuclear capability is an existential matter.  It is something that cannot be negotiated away because the ability to deliver nuclear weapons to the nation's most hated adversaries represents the realization of a dynastic vision that heralds celestial greatness, if not preeminence.  <br/><br/>Other factors -- North Korea's geography, recent military history, the balance of power in the far east, etc., play critical -- but ultimately secondary -- roles in the overall calculus, in my opinion.  I would like to think that I am wrong, but the North Koreans simply do think the way we do.  Kim Jong-un does not use anti-aircraft artillery to execute his enemies because he is trying to save bullets, for example.<br/><br/>Thus, it seems to me that the onus is on the rest of the civilized world to contain North Korea, to slow down and ultimately preclude further progress.  We certainly have failed to contain Iran. So let's not repeat those mistakes.<br/><br/>I'd take some of the $54 billion that will be given to DOD and develop an anti-missile system. Surely it can be done; Israel has Iron Dome. Meantime, squeeze Pyongyang financially, humiliate its leaders with sanctions, develop cyber capabilities, assassinate NK scientists associated with the missile program, send Navy SEALs to find the secret tunnels and labs.", "userDisplayName": "Frank Haydn Esq.", "assetID": 3466332, "recommendationCount": 1, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 78211779, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1508, "createDate": "1488657528", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-program-sabotage.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21686926, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488667760", "approveDate": "1488667760", "parentID": null, "rgt": 1511, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Los Angeles", "commentSequence": 21686926, "commentBody": "The only solution is to get South Korea to agree to take Nukes again.

However, the article also betrays the real intentions of North Korea in cases like \"North Korean leaders wanted the nuclear threat as a bargaining chip, to protect from American nuclear strikes\". That is all to it. If you want to consider Kim's all the blusters, then you have to be fearful of everyday. Kim and his previous adminstration actions suggest that they want nuclear weapons  to protect themselves from American threats. They will have it to prevent any so-called \"intervention\" from America like the Iraqi invasion in 2003, which again is nothing but a brutal invasion. Besides, those weapons would help North Korea to have a strong hand in the diplomacy, regarding South Korea or Japan in the region. On other hand, Kim or whatever leader in the North Korean regime would know trying a nuclear adventure, either in their region or against America, would mean the end of North Korea. Thus, It is only fiction to represent that leaders, like Kim, are lunatics and the general public or the media knows better than those leaders. Even South Koreans do not consider Kim's threats as \"real threats\" anymore.
