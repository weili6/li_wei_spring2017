It can't just be the US going alone. While sure, we could easily do this alone, we need China and Russia to be assured that this is not in attempt to maneuver against them. This is the only way to deal with North Korea. Not through cyber warfare, but real warfare. Not just through air attacks hoping people will then rise up to over throw the regime - the people are starving and too weak to do this. Troops will need to be on the ground. It shouldn't just be American troops either. This is truly an international effort.<br/><br/>Pacifism for North Korea will never work. The sooner we work with China, Russia, South Korea and Japan to agree to deal with this threat militarily the better we off. If I could trade the wars of Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan for any other war..it would be North Korea. They are the real threat to global security and peace. Sadly, I'm not sure if Trump is capable of building a coalition with China, Russia et al however hopefully he can try.
