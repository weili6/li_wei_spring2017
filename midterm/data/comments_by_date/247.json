Under the law, to place a wiretap, the FBI would have had to:present to a judge specific evidence of a suspected crime.  In this case, it was known that the Russians had hacked Hillary's emails, that Trump had denied it and defended the Russians, that the Russians had hacked Trump, but did nothing with what they learned, that Trump people had contacts with the Russians, and that the Russians much preferred Trump's elections to Hillary's.  That is ample evidence of probable cause, which is not to say that the Trump people committed crimes, only that  there was enough there to conclude that it was probable.  <br/><br/>Because the content of private conversations were the only definitive evidence of any criminal activity, a wiretap would surely have been authorized by a judge.
