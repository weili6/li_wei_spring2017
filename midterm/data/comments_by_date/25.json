In the Republican universe, anyone who is not in the top 1% has been left behind. And they will be left behind even further once Social Security and Medicare have been privatized and voucherized out of existence.  I and liberals like me have absolutely no use for your brand of Lord of the Flies conservatism.   Your policies and politics would have us go back to a period of time where all of the social and economic advancement that we have made will have been rolled back and at that point we might as well start using leeches again to cure our ills. Legal, constitutionally protected free speech is guaranteed as a right in this country and nothing that you  or your fellow Republican lackeys can do can change that fact. The right to peaceably assemble shall not be infringed. Obviously people who break the law should get arrested but after what your side pulled in 2010  at town hall meetings, which included openly carrying assault weapons, you have a lot of nerve to try to stifle free-speech now just because it's against your side.
