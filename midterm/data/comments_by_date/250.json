Ross's friend Josef Ackermann, the infamous banker who was kicked out of Deutschbank for misdeeds, has now found a comfy job in Cypress as Ross's replacement. That same Deutschbank is Trump's biggest lender, and it's also facing a huge fine from the DOJ, where Trump's pick Jeff Sessions is in charge.
