His coaching goes back to his father, his notorious lawyer associate Roy Cohn, and the manner in which he conducted his real estate dealing. When things are going down for Donald Trump, it is everybody else's fault; so you are correct in that we are dealing with a middle school mentality. In order to guarantee a victory in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump used below the belt tactics typical of the Republican party when they have their backs against the wall, but Trump took these tactics to a whole new level. He went so far as to suggest to the Russians to hack email servers, to which they complied and proceeded to let Mr. Trump in on the gig. I can see Trump now dancing a jig reminiscent of Hitler when he was informed of the leaks on the DNC. Now the entire gig is beginning to fall apart as more and more information is coming out, while the Russians are waiting for their favor of having sanctions to be relieved. How is the Donald going to get everyone to listen to him so he can pay off his favor to the Russians? Will the Russian ambassador crack?
