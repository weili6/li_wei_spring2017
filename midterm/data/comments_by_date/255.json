Remember how revolutionary it was when Steve's offered Mix-Ins with the ice cream? Line around the block on a warm night. And of course, there's Tufts and their Jumbos. A member of Somerville's Auxiliary Police Dep't got himself a job at MIT, where he was killed by the Boston Marathon bombers. The bombers had a favorite restaurant and a favorite auto mechanic in Somerville.<br/><br/>But I hope you can accept the reality that PAGAN KENNEDY (nee PAmela) - with her Wesleyan degree and her Johns Hopkins Master's - may have the sound judgment to ignore the Boston Americans, or whatever they call themselves these days.<br/><br/>This genius author has expertise in how things work. How they truly work.<br/><br/>Denizens of the hard-hat zone known as Fenway Park, adorned with a right-field line whose precise length cannot be measured if team security stops the measurer in time, have expertise in the opposite of how things work. A piano in a cranberry bog causes baseball games to have predictable results? A team that plays 7 games against one of the strongest existing teams often ends up beaten by that strong team ... so that means someone put a curse on someone? Paraphernailia buried in the concrete foundation of a ballpark in another city are supposed to mean something?<br/><br/>Not to mention, Kevin KENNEDY wasn't treated too well by the club.", "userDisplayName": "MTF Tobin", "assetID": 3466337, "recommendationCount": 0, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 26424636, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 30, "createDate": "1488672488", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/crosswords/variety-puzzle-acrostic.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21689106, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488672608", "approveDate": "1488672608", "parentID": null, "rgt": 31, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Brockport", "commentSequence": 21689106, "commentBody": "In this instance, Elementary means easy!", "userDisplayName": "Tim Lexvold", "assetID": 3466351, "recommendationCount": 0, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 7788002, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 30, "createDate": "1488672598", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/crosswords/its-elementary-seize-the-day.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21689099, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488672609", "approveDate": "1488672609", "parentID": null, "rgt": 15, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "South Florida", "commentSequence": 21689099, "commentBody": "Perhaps many of the people, in Congress, who wish to criminalize contraception, do so for ideological reasons   There will always be full-serviced physicians, and a trip to Canada is really not expensive these days.<br/><br/>That's part of the problem for the poor.  Many OB/GYNs don't take Medicaid--some 72% in Texas don't--and the GOP, now empowered by Trump are even trying to de-fund Planned Parenthood--a non-profit, nationwide source of General Medical Care for Women, accepts medicate, provides family planning and, yes, abortions--but that's only three percent of what they do.<br/><br/>The attacks on Women's Health Care are multi-pronged.  Many GOP-majority statehouses mandate abstinence only in high school sex ed, they didn't accept Extended Medicaid, and they have been passing laws that make it impossible for PPA to continue in business.  Meanwhile, wealthy women can just go to their usual OB/GYN and access the very fullest range of Women's health Care, for them and their daughter(s).  That includes Abortion.<br/><br/>This is what was so nefarious as to how they played with President Barack Obama's $1.9 Billion request to fight the Zika virus.  Florida and Texas have Republican Fivers and majority Legislatures, didn't accept Extended Medicaid and, yet, women who'd newborns might have been endangered by the evil effects, had no option.
