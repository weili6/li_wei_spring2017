And you don't understand what it's like to be that unwanted child.  <br/><br/>Just so you know, I'll tell you from my point of view, not for sympathy but for a dose of reality.  Being unwanted means being abused verbally and physically.  It means worrying that your parents will kill you.  It means not telling anyone anything because you can't trust them:  they will go back to your parents who will hurt you.  It affects you with respect to intimate relationships:  in my case I've never really had one.  Your parents demonstrate to you, in a variety of ways, including telling you that they didn't want you, how unwanted, unloved, and unlovable you are.  I'm 58 years old and I wish my parents had never had me.  And no, I wouldn't know the difference because I wouldn't be here.<br/><br/>Economic status is not the determining factor.
