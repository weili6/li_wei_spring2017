I was SICK of how the media fawned over Trump the other night...saying that \"AMERICA\" was bearing witness to Ryan Owens' wife's pain.  Yes, her pain is horrible but what about Trump's decision to send Owens on that mission -- and blaming the generals?  How will Trump make it up to the Owens family?  I don't think they care about how many minutes Trump got a standing ovation.<br/><br/>And what an ovation from the media!  Suddenly he has become a PRESIDENT because he read words on a teleprompter!  The man has the charisma and the voice to sell.  He is a SALESMAN.  So this is not a big surprise that he can read a speech.   Van Jones, give me a break.<br/><br/>This morning, Trump was probably alone with just his phone and needed to speak to America through his preferred device, Twitter.  What does he care about?
