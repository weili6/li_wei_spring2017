There are 7 billion people on this planet. We do not need unwanted babies/children nor do we need severely handicapped fetuses either (abortion may be necessary). Then we turn to the GOP's desire to defund national health care (no alternate plan to the ACA has been offered - Republicans are eliminating millions from health insurance). Why can America not have what the rest of the industrialized nations offer their citizens? Besides granting no care to many women and many average earning American families we find Republicans want to defund protection of our air and water quality. Next we learn they have no intention of working with the nations of our Earth to limit C02 pollution. Allowing the sale of assault weapons (only used to kill humans) is normalized. This Republican Party has metasticized into a powerful organization against much of humanity and our world. Every senator and representative should be ashamed of their acceptance and support of stupidity. Caring for all raises the whole boat. Caring for all benefits all of us.
