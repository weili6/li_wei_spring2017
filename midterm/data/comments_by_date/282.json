We need a system similar to what every other advanced nation has, something akin to single payer for everyone from birth. And yes, we do have one just like that already but it's only for senior citizens and the disabled. It's called Medicare and it's worked well for over a half century.<br/><br/>As for Roger's idea for an expanded national service system, I couldn't agree more.! It would solve several problems at once, not least young people learning empathy and communication skills but also help pay for higher education.<br/><br/>However (and I should capitalize the word), to think that someone as intellectually incurious and emotionally stunted as Trump could even digest this idea and run with it is ingenuous at best. And even more, he is in the presidential \"cocoon\" now surrounded by zealots who won't let ideas like this in (and he certainly won't hear about it on Fox News!).
