A story. Another marriage similar to yours is in my thoughts. The husband was dying. It was not a matter of \"if\" but \"when\" ... the couple stopped measuring time and focused on the quality of the love they shared. The husband passed away, his wife ... mmmm, let's say she took a while to move forward, but really, it was the time she needed to comprehend just want they had been through together. She took one day at a time. When well-meaning friends told her how strong she had been ... she remembered how strong her husband had been. Much stronger than she. A long story kept short by design, here in this comment. But recently, she told me she had found a special dish that he had kept. When she found it, she knew exactly why he had kept it. The special dish was from his parents' estate ... engraved \"25th Anniversary\" ... he had kept it, planning to be around for their 25th celebration. But finding the dish after his passing held just as much if not more meaning. He had planned to be there for their 25th. By keeping the dish, he expressed his love ... and when she found it, she knew. So, my gift to you ... love each other and forget time. Love.
