Nowadays people think each kid needs their own bedroom/bathroom and that you need a formal office, shiny new car and fancy vacations, and weddings that cost a fortune. <br/><br/>My generation (boomers) grew up sharing bedrooms or at least sharing a bath (I have a brother). Clothes were bought only twice a year. Toys were only for birthdays &amp; Christmas. No all the time consumerism.  My home had little furniture in the living room - a sofa, end tables, and a rocker. My brother and I used it as a playroom. <br/><br/>Eating out was only for special occasions. I enjoyed hand-me-down clothes from a cousin. <br/><br/>If people - especially couples starting out - lived like this, they'd avoid debt and be able to save for the future. And their kids would grow up without an entitlement attitude. <br/><br/>Many might say this advice is old-fashioned and that \"kids can't live without this, that or the other\" to which I would say - hogwash! My insurance agent has done very well yet his kids got no cars, have had to pay for the extras in college and started saving from the get-go. They are extremely mature and well prepared for their financial future. And adults?
