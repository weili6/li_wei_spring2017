That is because women, for the first time ever, have decent, reliable, affordable health care.  When Republicans want to end financing for these clinics because they occasionally provide abortion, they are actually increasing the birth rate AND the abortion rate.  Plus, if legal abortions aren't allowed, then women will go to the butchers who provided abortions before Roe vs. Wade.

Maybe he could argue innocence by reason of mental defect or disability, but all that should get him is equal time in a prison psych ward. That he often speaks like a 6 year old and displays what used to be called \"ideas of reference\" would only further his claim, should he make it.

Well there ya go.<br/>On the other hand there are, in fact, those who are plotting against DJT, and not just the alien robot vampire zombies from planet Znargh (forgive me, Gahan Wilson). Better than half the country finds him nauseating, and more than half the world believes him to be a Russian agent. To date his administration seems like a poorly executed parody of \"Dr. Strangelove meets Dr. Evil\", with a healthy dose of Abbott and Costello thrown in. Where are the Bowery Boys when we need them? My personal belief is he's one of those aliens from \"Independence Day\" with a slimy homunculus inside the overly large and super scary monster suit. On the other hand it could be reasonably argued that inside is empty, nobody home. Maybe he's just the StayPuft marshmallow man. Putin must be chortling in his caviar over this fine mess he's gotten us into.
