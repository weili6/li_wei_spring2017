The point is that Trump doesn't concern himself with \"women's (or girl's in this case) issues which he made a point of delegating to his self promoting brand obsessed daughter, Ivanka.  In case you didn't notice, the President is only concerned with the health &amp; fate of fellow billionaires therefore he panders to the Conservative right wing supporters who have made a deal with the Devil in order to have a President who will support their agenda.  This is why when he gives promises about not allowing any Americans to die in the street, out of the other side of his mouth he approves of repealing &amp; replacing the ACA which will eventually drastically reduced Medicaid payments by capping them &amp; replacing subsidies for low income people (under $50-60k income sliding scale) with tax credits &amp; health savings accounts (for taxpayers earning over $80k/year).  This strategy is purposeful as he has literally written off low income people as those that either don't vote or worse, vote Democratic.  This cold hearted GOP strategy that caters to upper middle class to billionaire classes has written off the less fortunate as takers or those disabled kids who will be turned away from private religious schools thus warehoused in increasingly underfunded public schools.", "userDisplayName": "carla van rijk", "assetID": 3466347, "recommendationCount": 20, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 55570583, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 224, "createDate": "1488680649", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/opinion/sunday/shes-17-and-needs-birth-control-do-we-turn-our-backs.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21687468, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488680709", "approveDate": "1488680709", "parentID": 21676633, "rgt": 84, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Southeastern PA", "commentSequence": 21687468, "commentBody": "Social security is an entitlement, one you are entitled to because you earned it with your contributions.
