If a worker saves and invests in a low cost plain vanilla S&amp;P fund, they will better be able to care for themselves which should lighten the need for the entitlement programs Republicans hate to fund.  Yes, Wall Street will get something out of it but costs can be a few tenths of a percentage point. Most IRAs can be rolled over from one plan to the next, so if a worker moves from one state to the next it should be able to move with him if he wants, or as is the case now he can chose to leave it with his old employer/state plan.  Multiple plans are no more a problem than multiple bank accounts.  I have two Traditional IRAs (one a rolled over 401K) and two Roth IRAs.  Discount brokers charge me nothing to hold the accounts and when I want to roll one to a different broker, I fill out the paperwork with the new broker and they do all the work of moving the stocks, bonds and/or cash.", "userDisplayName": "mzmecz", "assetID": 3466316, "recommendationCount": 0, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 66159958, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 46, "createDate": "1488662296", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/upshot/state-ira-plans-are-ready-if-congress-doesnt-interfere.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21689760, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488681091", "approveDate": "1488681091", "parentID": null, "rgt": 3803, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "St. Augustine", "commentSequence": 21689760, "commentBody": "Again Trump shows his weakness.

She now does not have to take medications anymore due to the conditions she had when she was obese. Hurray! Why cannot more folks do this? Sure they can!
