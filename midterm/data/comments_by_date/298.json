Calling all such moves with the knee-jerk label of appeasement achieves nothing positive at all and only increases the worst possible consequences.<br/><br/> Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter both have personally visited Pyongyang in the past to defuse situations on the brink. I don't know about Clinton now , but President Carter still may have enjoy some trust in North Korea. It certainly wouldn't hurt to deploy his good offices one more time.
