The real world threat is the US, it has always been, it holds half of the mexican territory and that goes unmentioned as well as a thousand other crimes because it holds its power with military strength and it's always itching to use it. What is even more frightining is when you see that is not only the goverment but also the civil population who think they have right to destroy a whole nation ; how many children, women, elders and men in NK?

We once again find our global security alarmingly dictated by nothing more than simple geography. The situation isn't really unusual but I tend to forget the basics every once in a while. North Korea exists because North Korea has mountains and caves. There's not much more to it than that.<br/><br/>We can talk about geo-politics and the Korean War. They are certainly relevant. More appropriately though, we should be talking about the continuing Sino-American War. North Korea is the small cog in the larger and more ancient Chinese, Japanese, and Russian struggle. The US jumped into the fray when we denuded Japanese military influence.<br/><br/>If you think about it though, every major conflict has been decided by a combination of technology, resources, and geography. By resources, I mean many things so please take the term loosely. My point though: geography traditionally defines the latter forces. Even an ICBM, right? You need to get the missile some place.<br/><br/>Now I'm not so sure. There are limitations to any cyber arsenal but I think we have a larger concern than a nuclear North Korea. Mr. Kim might prove the flash point but imagine a massive military conflict where geography mostly doesn't matter. What does the Monroe Doctrine even mean when networks are weapons?
