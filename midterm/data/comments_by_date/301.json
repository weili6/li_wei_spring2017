First, it depends on what kind of culture the seventeen year old lives in - a sexually restrictive, semi restrictive or permissive culture. The U.S. fits into the semi-restrictive category, so definitely give them birth control, because this is the most dangerous type of culture for young lovers. In this culture we TELL adolescents not to have sex, but then we leave them alone. As a result, compared to the other types of culture, we have more teen pregnancies and some seriously skyrocketing std issues.<br/>Restrictive cultures, where men and women are just kept apart and everyone knows how horny and impulsive 17 year olds can be, so they really just keep them apart so they won't have sex, maybe not, but if they are asking, well then, they have found a way, so yeah, even though statistics say the odds are lower teens will have sex. In permissive cultures - Northern Europe, this article would just get a laugh because there, they teach teens what they need to know and give them what they need to protect themselves and teens are allowed to couple up. And they also have low teem pregnancy rates.<br/>Oh, and by the way - when you are around someone who is allowing, accepting, warm, attentive, and appreciative? You are in the presence of someone who is mature.
