Note that Obama\u2019s denial doesn\u2019t contradict this in any way.<br/><br/>The real question is whether this would be proper.<br/><br/>One perspective is that Obama was simply doing his job very professionally. Based on some possible evidence of election tampering by the Russians, he reasonably ordered an investigation, but properly recused himself from specific actions like requesting a wiretap.<br/><br/>The other perspective is that Obama was abusing his power by having one of his close associates launch an investigation to discredit a political opponent.  He informally directed an appointee to request a wiretap, achieving his goals while maintaining deniability.<br/><br/>The choice of perspective is informed mostly by partisan leanings, but not published facts.  As such, the best approach would be a full disclosure of who ordered the investigation, who ordered the wiretap, and and what evidence was used to justify the request/approval. <br/><br/>These facts should eventually come out once the FBI completes its investigation.
