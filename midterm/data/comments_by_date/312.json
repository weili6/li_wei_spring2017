With repeal, an average of $33,000 of tax cuts goes to the richest 1% this year, &amp; $197,000 of tax cuts to the top 0.1 %. 400 highest-income taxpayers (incomes  more than $300 million each) receive annual tax cuts of about $7 million. Also increased are taxes on families earning between $10,000 &amp; $75,000 \u2013 including most of GOP's working class voters. <br/><br/> With GOP repeal, 32 million people lose their health insurance, tens of thousands of Americans die because of lack of medical care they need,  Medicare becomes worse , the rich becoming far richer. <br/><br/> The sanctimonious, hypocritical Tea Party-Trump-Paul Ryan-GOP plans to wholly abandon the interests of their own voters &amp; become unapologetic forces for the wealthiest members of society. GOP proposals shower huge benefits on rich Americans &amp; leave the rest of us, including most of their own constituency, in the lurch.", "userDisplayName": "F.Douglas Stephenson, LCSW, BCD", "assetID": 3466303, "recommendationCount": 6, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 39814353, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 186, "createDate": "1488686008", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/upshot/obamacare-got-their-goat-an-illustrated-guide-to-republicans-metaphors.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21691678, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488686048", "approveDate": "1488686048", "parentID": null, "rgt": 4237, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Fresno, California", "commentSequence": 21691678, "commentBody": "Add paranoia to Trump's troubling personality profile.", "userDisplayName": "Jim Steinberg", "assetID": 3466349, "recommendationCount": 43, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 29629210, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 4236, "createDate": "1488686014", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/us/politics/trump-obama-tap-phones.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21690384, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488686055", "approveDate": "1488686055", "parentID": null, "rgt": 4243, "replyCount": 2, "userLocation": "Los Angeles", "commentSequence": 21690384, "commentBody": "Name your sources!", "userDisplayName": "Kimzim", "assetID": 3466349, "recommendationCount": 69, "status": "approved", "replies": {"comments": [{"commentID": 21691764, "commentSequence": 21691764, "editorsSelection": false, "updateDate": "1488721125", "depth": 1, "approveDate": "1488721125", "userURL": "NULL", "parentID": 21690384, "createDate": "1488686659", "parentUserDisplayName": "Kimzim", "recommendations": 0, "commentBody": "the main source is Donald Trump's twitter account", "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "Linda L", "status": "approved", "recommendedFlag": 0, "userID": 6642994, "commentType": "userReply", "replies": [], "userTitle": "NULL", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Washington, DC"}, {"commentID": 21692162, "commentSequence": 21692162, "editorsSelection": false, "updateDate": "1488724897", "depth": 1, "approveDate": "1488724897", "userURL": "NULL", "parentID": 21690384, "createDate": "1488690336", "parentUserDisplayName": "Kimzim", "recommendations": 0, "commentBody": "Usually it is his \"very good brain\".
