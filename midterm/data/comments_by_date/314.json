I am also an adoptee, born in 1968 to a poor woman who went to the emergency room with a stomach ache, and left having given birth to me. She did not know that she was pregnant, and she suffered because of that trauma for the rest of her too short life. She never had other children.  And then, one night, it was me who made a mistake. As a result, I chose to have an abortion. I wasn't ready to be a mother, and I *quite literally* could not have lived with myself if I surrendered a child for adoption.
