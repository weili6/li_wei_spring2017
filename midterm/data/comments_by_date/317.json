First it has taken me a long time to write and say exactly what I want to say.  I am 57, my wife died when we were 40.  She was pregnant with our youngest child and 3 months after delivery, was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She died approximately 13 months later.  One is never prepared but on hindsight, I would have done the following.  Your husband sounds wonderful and I can only hope my wife thought the same....I believe she did.  My deepest regret is not taking those remaining 13 months and doing something special just with her.  Of course there were kids including a newborn, but all the promises and hopes from some very compassionate people prevented me from doing something unique and wonderful solely with her.  Yes, the doctors, nurses, administrators, etc. are looking and hoping for the cure but take your husband and do something that the two of you always wanted to do.  It can be corny, adventurous, rugged, simple, exotic, expensive, whatever....but do it.  I don't have the word but I have the phrase.....My Friend.  God Bless you and I can only imagine the thoughts going through your mind as you wrote this.  You are a wonderful person and I wish your family all the best.
