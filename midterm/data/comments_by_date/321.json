Better physicans are open to dialog with note-taking, question asking patients.  But even they wait for patients to initiate.<br/><br/>Physicians willingness to talk also varies inversely with the intensity specialty.  I find internists and dermatologists pretty open, but surgeons particularly terse.  Still, the better ones are frank and to the point about their experience and success with specific procedures.  Anyone unwilling to state their batting average probably doesn't have anything to brag about.<br/><br/>More than profit, I suspect that medicine's inability to purge itself of second rate practitioners undermines doctor-patient exchanges.  Too often, doctors' recite caveats with equivocating language as coached by malpractice attorneys.<br/><br/>To have more honest and equal exchange between doctors and patients, doctors must be more honest about driving out their underperforming colleagues.

I've always thought of the decision to have surgery as a joint decision between equal partners, and the consent process as a sort of \"so what are YOU looking for in a relationship?\" conversation.<br/>These discussions take time.  I book 40 minutes for a new patient appointment, usually a 20 minute follow up visit to discuss options, then a 30-40 minute visit for the formal consent process.  I've tried many different tools to enhance understanding - three dimensional anatomy models, paper handouts, computer animations, personalized illustrations of before and after.  I've even tried a quiz, as mentioned in the article.<br/>My patients' responses to the quiz (single page, 5 questions) were highly variable.  Most women were happy to participate, since it was clear that I wanted to make sure they understood their surgery.  Some astonished me with their level of understanding...\"you'll make an incision here!  Then you clamp the ligament here!  Then you divide the artery here!  What do you do with the tube-y thing at the top?\"<br/>There seems to be a small percentage of patients who are of the Jesus-take-the-wheel mode of thinking...they would look at the quiz, become visibly uncomfortable, and hand it back saying something along the lines of, \"you're my doctor and I trust you.\"<br/>I think every patient desires a slightly different amount of information.

Full stop.<br/><br/>I saw this first hand when my father was treated at one of New York's premier surgical hospitals, by a leading physician.  My father was a sophisticated consumer of medical services, yet in the months leading up to his surgery, my parents would relate what the surgeon said, and invariably certain facts would change.  Naturally, I assumed my elderly parents were mishearing the surgeon, so I began to attend my father's appointments.  What I found was that the surgeon would provide me mutually exclusive answers the same questions.<br/><br/>Equally worrisome, was the fact that after the surgery, my father experienced a complication that all the nurses stated was commonplace, yet the surgeon had never mentioned.  Moreover, the physicians disputed that the complication was common as the nurses who treated the patients on a daily basis indicated.  Who to believe?<br/><br/>When my father required additional surgery, he needed to be taken off of blood-thinning medication.  This was a great concern, given the risk of blood clots and stroke.  Only after the procedure, due to which he suffered a stroke, did we learn there was a medication that he could have been given which would have mitigated the risk of clots.  While there are countervailing risks with the drug, it was never discussed with my father.  How does a patient know to ask about a drug which is not disclosed?  How does a patient determine what risks to accept when their physicians hid information?", "userDisplayName": "JEG", "assetID": 3466225, "recommendationCount": 9, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 18215173, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 454, "createDate": "1488595228", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/well/live/informed-patient-dont-bet-on-it.html", "userURL": "NULL"}], "api_timestamp": "1488826896"}, "debug": {"version": 3.1}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
