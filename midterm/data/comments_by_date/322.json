As someone who suffered a mild TBI nearly 3 years ago, I have had to be my own investigator, advocate, and test subject. Doctors will prescribe medications assuming they have been tested on people with TBIs when they haven't. When I find things online written by other TBI survivors, I get the validation for my side effects that my doctor refused me. I also find info on simple treatments regarding diet/supplements and exercise (mental and physical) that most doctors won't take the time to learn about, or disparage because they aren't from big pharma.<br/>There are two problems that this article doesn't take into account: 1.) Not every medical condition has been given the same amount of research dollars and attention, so what doctors think they know may not even be accurate. Case in point: now that the DOD/VA are doing so much more research into TBI, there is the theory that the much-maligned and dismissed 'post-concussion syndrome' might actually be manifestations of neuroendocrine dysfunction. Too bad for all of those people who were told they were just malingering. And 2.) how can doctors who are expected to treat perhaps dozens of different ailments possibly keep up to date on every new discovery and treatment guideline? They can't, and they should be able to admit it. When informed patients do bring in peer-reviewed studies to discuss, doctors' egos lead them to stubbornly dig in and stonewall.

The system within which healthcare is provided is broken and fractured. Out healthcare system is currently being run as a business, which it is not. Insurance and for-profit healthcare systems are trying to pay their CEOs unheard of salaries, and physician's are being given more and more administrative work to do in less and less time because they have to see more and more patients to pay their bosses bigger and bigger salaries. Look it up. It's all true. <br/><br/>Medical information continues to expand at lightening speed. We are asked to present complex and nuanced information to people who are afraid, often don't have long term relationships with the doctors who give them this complex information, which diminishes trust and the ability to communicate effectively. <br/><br/>I beg of anyone reading this to investigate single payor systems. Give physician's reasonable salaries rather than a per-patient salary, give them more time per patient, eliminate the insurance and business types who demand huge salaries for no value, provide an electronic medical charting system that is easy to use and communicates relevant medical information instead of bean-counter nonsense.
