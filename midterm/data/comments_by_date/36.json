What I am not ignorant of is this: The Constitution and all the law speech over the history of the U.S. is something of a game equivalent to board games or sports rules or card games except not only has cheating never been prevented, the rules themselves have never been agreed upon and people interpret as they will, or make up rules or invent loopholes left and right. With the result that what has actually occurred in America today for all Constitution and rights is just vast and confusing administrative, bureaucratic, technocratic, law enforcement apparatus in which we all are entangled.<br/><br/>It all appears just an insidious game of snare the opponent. You get in your car and drive around and all the cars on the road cannot be distinguished between citizen and police or military or what have you (all the sunglasses, tinted windows, big official looking vehicles,--the authoritativeness of it all), and you step into any building or conversation associated with government and it is a maze of legalese/government speech in which no one can clearly state the rules much less assure integrity, so I fully expect both political parties to become more intimidating, official, Constitutional, \"living and dead\".", "userDisplayName": "Daniel12", "assetID": 3466322, "recommendationCount": 1, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 67971822, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 618, "createDate": "1488631856", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/against-protests-republicans-must-stand-strong.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21682566, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488632339", "approveDate": "1488632339", "parentID": null, "rgt": 621, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Rochester NY", "commentSequence": 21682566, "commentBody": "Mr Walker fails to mention the core issues that have contributed to the need for increased federal power over the economic, environmental, educational and social policies of our nation.<br/><br/>In our country, when state governments predominate over the federal, regional defacto oligarchies have instituted policies to repress major segments of our population.  Sometimes the oppression has been used to the economic advantage of the oligarchies.  The history of slavery is the obvious example but the Kansas trickle down debacle should not be ignored.

Sometimes over the right to unionize; read the history of the transportation industries.<br/><br/>If Mr Walker's view prevailed in 1957, Eisenhower would not have been able to use the power of the federal government in Little Rock nor would JFK have been able to make a difference when Maddox and Wallace blocked school doors.<br/><br/>The point is that our nation needs a consistent application of laws enabling liberties in our country if we are to remain a single nation.
