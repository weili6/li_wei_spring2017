Bush after 9/11`. Republicans saw Benghazi as a political opportunity); a private email server, never hacked.<br/>But a US enemy illegally hacking one party's emails in order to interfere with out election and help throw it to its preferred candidate, an Attorney General lying while under oath to Congress regarding this serious matter, among others, causes yawns amongst Republicans.
