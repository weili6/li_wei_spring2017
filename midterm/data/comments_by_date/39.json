Your administration has continued to take away local control in the actions of you and the legislature since 2010.  You overrode the vote of the majority of voters in our county that wanted to retain stronger protection of our lakes and rivers, you overrode the majority vote for stronger public schools in our county, and you overrode the majority of voters that wanted stronger land use regulation in our county.   Your concern for state control rather than federal is in direct contradiction to what you are doing in your own state where the legislature and yourself  are overriding the wishes of the voters in the counties and towns.
