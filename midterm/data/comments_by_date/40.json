Illinois, as it happens, is an example of a state in conflict because a Republican gov is standing so strong (like Walker, against unions) that we havent had a budget in 2.5 years, Chicago's been robbed of its $ for the public schools, social services throughout the state are getting cut and vendors going unpaid. Too bad financial whiz Rauner wont ask for a microtax on stock trades. Luckily he's facing election next year.

It's the states that failed the desperate voters who supported this train wreck.

Do you think it's a coincidence that voters in Massachusetts and California don't feel like they're suffering? No. It's because our states support taxation as a means for creating a just and civilized society. What have the 33 states with republican governors done for working people? Busted unions? That helps the wealthy, whose taxes you cut. And don't take credit for the increase in jobs. There are more jobs everywhere since we recovered from the financial crisis brought to us by the moneyed interests. Obama's stimulus Brought back jobs. Financial austerity? That worked well in Kansas! Draconian laws on social issues? Backfired in Indiana and NC.

They are for the benefit of the participants, let them feel their collective strength, to energize them for the fights to come, a coming together in solidarity, like a Fourth of July parade.
