Because punishment and blame is what our welfare policy has always been about.<br/><br/>Real public assistance would really assist people, give them chances in life, not hand out niggardly benefits designed to prevent the poor from dying on the streets.<br/><br/>Real public assistance would begin with employers.  It would make policy reflect the needs and the dignity of workers.  It would make certain jobs exist.<br/><br/>Real public assistance would recognize that anyone could need help.  Abandoned by for-maximum-profit insurance-based healthcare, or by some corporation out to maximize next week's profits at the expense of life-long employees, people get into dire circumstances.  Ungrudging, reliable social support would rush them back onto their feet .<br/><br/>In the 90s I was an activist in NYC.  Chained myself to desks in Albany and all.  The debate at the time was forcing people to work for benefits.  Conservatives argued that welfare made people benefit-sucking zombies.<br/>Stories flowed about Cadillacs, idleness, lobster. The up-shot was that 'these people' had no incentive to work, and Republicans were going to 'help them' off welfare.<br/><br/>I returned to Manhattan and the renovated Plaza to see at six in the chilly morning a line three blocks long of people so hungry to work they were competing for demeaning, low paying jobs as housekeepers.

Women who vote are annoying.  They even think they can be president!  WORSE those women think they should be able to control their own bodies.<br/><br/>Well, let's just leave it up to the states.  Some states might let women vote and some states, well, they might return to their sense and put those females in their place.<br/><br/>Civil rights.  Hah, you ask.  What about the civil rights of the embattled white Christian male?  Let's fix that.  We can leave it up to the states whether they think women should vote, labor should be paid, and schools should be segregated (choice!) and mostly, what color people should be allowed to vote.<br/><br/>Indeedy!

It fits in splendidly with your proposition, governor, to allow the citizens of this or that state to just get sick and die already.<br/><br/>After all, who needs a country full of healthy, well-educated, color-blind citizens who think women should be able to vote and workers should get paid?", "userDisplayName": "Sophia", "assetID": 3466322, "recommendationCount": 2, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 21242913, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 694, "createDate": "1488611133", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/against-protests-republicans-must-stand-strong.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21681222, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488633232", "approveDate": "1488633232", "parentID": 21679879, "rgt": 232, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Milky Way", "commentSequence": 21681222, "commentBody": "I grew up in Wisconsin.
