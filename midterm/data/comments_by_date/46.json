However, I would like to respectfully provide a contrary opinion from the surviving spouse that may help people understand terminal illness and grief.<br/><br/>My spouse and I were together for 27 years. Sixteen of those years were spent dealing with catastrophic illness. The end did not come quickly and the suffering was unbearable to witness. Had my spouse tried to find me another partner during that time, I would have been devastated. Looking at life beyond my spouse's death during those tragic days would have been unthinkable. My love and life were focused on being the strength and support that my spouse needed. The concept of finding another partner never crossed my mind even months and two years beyond the day we said our final goodbye. Grieving is a critical part of life and relationships. It cannot be fast-forwarded.  It is a slow and painful process. It requires wandering in unknown territory. <br/><br/>The reality is we are all terminal. Some of us simply reach the airport departure gate before others do. My advice is allow your loved ones to be with you and love you. They will find their way after your death. None of us have control. The fact of the matter is that many widows and widowers choose to remain single. That's OK. We must each find our own path in this life but we must be allowed to do so in our own time.<br/><br/>Blessings!", "userDisplayName": "Ann", "assetID": 3466311, "recommendationCount": 8, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 67813307, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 1342, "createDate": "1488596624", "commentTitle": "n/a", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/style/modern-love-you-may-want-to-marry-my-husband.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21683036, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488633730", "approveDate": "1488633730", "parentID": null, "rgt": 1597, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "California", "commentSequence": 21683036, "commentBody": "Trump is solely responsible for the rise of suspicions about his ties to Russia.  <br/><br/>His failure to release his tax returns and his unusual admiration of Putin and softer stance on Russia gave rise to the  initial suspicion that perhaps he had financial reasons for his stance.

So carry on with the contacts but do so openly and within normal protocol.  And don't deny it, or forget about it.<br/><br/>Improving relations with Russia is a good goal.  But what is the cost of doing so?
