He was as good a father as a son could ask for-and my sister would agree.   But my Dad also served in the Army, he served his community, and he served his faith.  He tirelessly contributed to the poor.  I remember at every semester's end when he would take our textbooks and novels that we were required to purchase and just drive to a very poor neighborhood and knock on doors until he found someone whose family could use them.  He was an amazing son to my Grandmother, a better sibling his brothers and sisters could not have asked for: he was a man of rare integrity.  And he was amazingly good looking through his late 70's-and beyond.  Sorry ladies, he passed away six years after the love of his life.

After all, they successfully used incessant investigations of Hillary Clinton to discredit her, despite not finding anything particularly damning, and there are still people who believe that Barack Obama was not born in the United States despite all evidence to the contrary.

I didn't vote for Clinton or Trump.  I'm as interested as anyone else for an investigation, but my understanding was that the intelligent communities were already investigating it since the campaign.  So, what's taking so long?  Why is there not enough information yet to form conclusions? Or will we be tying up government and stagnating due to partisan politics for another administration?  <br/><br/>Meanwhile Obama ruled the roost with executive orders that provoked anger, while Repubs and Dems in Congress brought governing to a halt.  And now we have a new administration and the same thing is happening.  No governing.  Just mud slinging.  And the Democratic party can not pretend to not be 1000% motivated in removing Trump from office.  Anyone that denies that is fooling no one.  There is an organized attempt to overthrow the administration.  <br/><br/>So I agree with dog secrets - both parties are not worth supporting.  And just the fact that only 3 people up voted this comment, tells you all you need to know about the hypocrisy and denial of Democrats, who continue to suggest that only the Republicans are a problem.
