That  may well tie into their aggressive efforts to tamper with the election.  What better way to get guidance on how to sabotage Hillary than going to the Trump people?  From there, there are three possibilities.  The Russians may have been very discrete, directing conversations to helpful topics while concealing their true purpose.  Or they may have directed conversations to matters that revealed their purpose with nobody acknowledging what was apparent.  Or they may have engaged in an out and out conspired with the Trump people.  The most likely scenario is the second -- the Trump people understood what the Russians were up to, but the two sides acted as if the conversations were innocuous.  Whether that was criminal depends upon how clear the Russians' intentions were and to what extent the Trump people were ignoring the obvious. If the Americans taped  the conversations, the tapes are available by subpoena.  Russian tapes are not because the Russians have diplomatic immunity.

In 2005, I too had vague abdominal pain and distention.  A CT scan showed a very enlarged ovary, and I briefly shared your diagnosis of ovarian cancer.  The next day, however, a surgeon found the diagnosis that you had been expecting:  a large appendiceal abscess, adjacent to a normal ovary.  (While I received the better diagnosis, I never found the soul mate and family that you did--guess none of us gets to have it all.)  But I knew that I had been given a new lease on life that day, and confess that I have let myself drift into the mundane details of life rather than the joy.  Thank you for reminding me of my resolution to live life to the fullest, \"Plan Be\"!  You are so generous to share these words with us when evidence of true love in the world is much too sparse.  I look forward to knowing you better by reading your other works and wish you peace and love on your journey.  And hope perhaps even to meet you on the other side.
