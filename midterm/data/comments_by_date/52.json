Before marriage all my good qualities came from my father and mother, and some from my grandfather too. After marriage, all additions and renovations to my persona were my wife's works. Nita left this planet last year, exactly 41 years to the day when we first met - a few months before our 40th wedding anniversary. I miss her all the time, every day of the week, every hour. My eyes, too, often well up with water and I make no attempt to curb or  control it. I consider those tears as symbols of my deep, deep love for her. Sorta my valentine greetings for her, tears filling in for words that fail me at the time I look for them. Love is the most wonderful of all human feelings and experience. Hold on to it with dear life, if you are lucky to experience it.
