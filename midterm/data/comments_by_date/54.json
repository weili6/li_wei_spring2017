I have been here on earth quite a long time now, always waiting for the time that I would meet the special person that I have always instinctively knew would arrive.  When i read your message, and your beautiful sharing about Jason I had a feeling, YES!  like this... a man who knows how to love, and who has lived through the greatest of life's loves and life's heartbreaks.  There are not so many people, men or women who can brave such depth and breadth of life and choose to continue with an open heart.  I am a spiritual counselor whose place in this world is at the veil between this world and the next. May your transition be beauty filled even as I know your human heart will ache in the pre- mature departure from this world.  So much love and light await you as your journey continues in other realms.  And if your beloved Jason finds himself ready to reach for more love and joy as you have shared with him I would be honored to know him, as friend, as fellow travel on the path of love and loss and as companion in what ever form.  blessings of grace to you.

If a citizen happens to believe that a decision make by the current administration is good for this country that citizen is immediately pounced upon by multiple liberals.
