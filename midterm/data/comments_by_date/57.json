I just shudder when I think of what chaos Trump is about to unleash : anti-pollution regulations gutted, mass deportations, a new healthcare plan that rewards the rich and the healthy while neglecting the most vulnerable, a school system designed for Christian fundamentalists and science deniers, and an Attorney General's Office that shows no interest in protecting the rights of minorities.

Key to his ambition is the reacquisition of territories occupied by the former USSR. Hence his armed occupation Crimea. But before he can exert greater military force he must neutralize the opposition. That means weaken the NATO alliance, disrupt the EU, foment instability in individual western European democracies. Simply put: divide and conquer. He facilitates these ends by promoting nationalistic/isolationist right wing politics in western european democracies and the USA. Western security services report that Trumps\u2019 win, Brexit, and the pending elections in France and Germany have all been subjected to surreptitious Russian electioneering. <br/><br/>In the short run, Putin seeks elimination of the crippling economic sanctions imposed by Obama in response to his annexation of Crimean and to avoid a more muscular in-kind response to his increasing military assertiveness. In contrast to Trumps stated friendly intentions, neither of these goals would likely have been achieved under a Clinton administration.
