What might be considered is jettisoning 18th and 19th century political borders within the United States so there is some rough correspondence between economic regions and governmental ones.  Truth is, the United States is part of the reshaping of the world, and that reshaping is reducing the importance \"Western civilization\" achieved owing to European exploitation of the Western hemisphere.  Well, China and India are regaining the importance that had more than 500 years age, and the adjustment is painful for \"the West.\"", "userDisplayName": "John Lee Kapner", "assetID": 3466322, "recommendationCount": 0, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 54770547, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 832, "createDate": "1488633453", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/against-protests-republicans-must-stand-strong.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21683014, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488635238", "approveDate": "1488635238", "parentID": null, "rgt": 835, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "commentSequence": 21683014, "commentBody": "Scott Walker can tout his achievements all he wants but the constant draining of education funds to our universities has made the state less attractive to high tech businesses.

A combination of big money and rigging elections has given us a raft of GOP politicians whose main goal is upward redistribution of wealth. Walker's claim that the GOP is all about states rights is pure bunk. States rights and local control are invoked whenever convenient, scrapped when the locals do something the servants of the wealthy deplore, such as raise the minimum wage or impose a family leave policy. Taking health care, one shortcoming of the ACA was that it left too much to the states, where Republican governors and legislatures could cripple it and then blame the Democrats. Walker may be an honest politician in the sense that he stays bought, but otherwise he's the poster child for just what this country does not need. A national election demonstrated that quite clearly, as he was the first to drop out of the presidential contest; no wonder he prefers state-level politics.
