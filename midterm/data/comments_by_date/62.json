This should include business as well as the influence of foreign governments whether Russian, Saudi, Israeli or Chinese. As for the focus on Russia we are seeing, it is vital that we separate actual harmful conflicting connections and influence from overblown narratives pushed to promote pretexts for a National Security State coup with dangerous implications.

I've also been hearing about Obama having hired operatives with his Foundation in order to sabotage the Trump administration.
