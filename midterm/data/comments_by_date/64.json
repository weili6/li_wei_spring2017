You think, maybe they were angry? The idea that the Federal government is the enemy is, simply, foolish. You write about your successes. I see them as failures. <br/><br/>It takes enormous hubris to ignore the will of 100,000 people in one state. Did it not ever occur to you that they were angry for a reason? Did it not occur to you to question your convictions which so many dislike? You are so sure you know what's right. Well, maybe not. <br/><br/>You, as an educated, white, male, wealthy person would never conclude that you had something to learn from your own citizens. Too bad. It might make you a better governor. And a better person. Cutting taxes is always the answer, except that it's not. Supply side economics has never worked. Guess you missed that. OK, so you have a balanced budget, but how many hungry children do you also have? How many lousy schools?<br/><br/>I consider it a gift to be \"liberal\". I care about people (whomsoever they may be), the environment (all of it), the poor, elderly, infirm, un-employed and the children. I believe the government of the richest country in the world can easily afford to spend more on its land and people and less on the military. Spend more on schools and teachers. And, yes, unlike Mr. Trump, I am happy to pay taxes if they are used to alleviate those problems.

Our Wisconsin governor who has no college degree who appointed the head of our Natural Resources a woman, Cathy Stepp, who has no college degree.

Death threats, so dramatic.  And he lived through it, he says.  There were protests by hundreds of thousands, true.  Death threats? Ummm.....<br/><br/>Truth is Walker never said one thing about getting rid of public employees' rights being taken away from them when he ran in 2010.  People didn't know about his conversation with millionaires when he said he was going to \"divide and conquer\".  People didn't know he was going to decimate public school funding and knock our UW system to its knees with $$$ cuts.<br/><br/>People didn't know he would come in and be paid off to have a mine in northern Wisconsin that would poison our waters and put a Native American tribe in danger.  They finally backed out.<br/><br/>People didn't know he was basically paying business people millions of dollars under the table with a \"new agency\" he made up to \"save Wisconsin\" which has been another fiasco.<br/><br/>People didn't know he would allow the care at our veterans hospital and children's juvenile centers to blow to the wind and now both be under federal investigation.<br/><br/>Yes, Scott Walker is a real gem.
