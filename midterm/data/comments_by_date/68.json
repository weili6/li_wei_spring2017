I am the woman who married the man like your husband. He had been married for nearly 34 years. I had been for 31. We both lost our spouses. I never thought I would marry again. But the first time I saw him, I knew. I want you to know that you will always be important to your husband. I know that much of his first wife, Joyce, makes up much of who he is now, and I know she was a beautiful woman. I know he loved her deeply. I know she loved him. I know she was a good mom because I know her girls. I know she was a great friend, because I know her friends. I feel like I knew her. I would want her to know how much her husband loved her and that she is the reason why he was willing to marry again. The legacy she left has left an indelible mark upon her husband and her world. I stumbled on your article this morning while surfing the internet, so this is the first I time I heard about you. I will look for more of your writings now. I will pray for you.
