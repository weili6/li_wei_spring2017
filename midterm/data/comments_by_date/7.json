Session's cutesy pixie smile and pleas of forgetfulness remind me of what a stereotypical Southern belle would act like if pulled over by a traffic cop.  She would inevitably smile, feign ignorance of the law or play up her ditsy women in distress playing card before the traffic cop, who in most cases would feel sorry for her pathetic case and let her on her way out of sympathy for her damsel in distress persona.  Similarly, Sessions, who is in the top cop position, claims that when he lied about not having any contacts with Russians during the Trump campaign, that he was forgetful.  Would this testimony fly if the defendant was an Al Qaeda sympathizer who claimed to have forgotten that he had contact with jihadis during a time that the FBI was investigating anyone who was involved with jihadi recruitment in the US?  Also, the FBI as an institution was tarnished when Director Comey gave a suspicious press conference just weeks before the election regarding Hillary Clinton's e-mails even though we now know there was no there there and her account was never hacked unlike VP Mike Pence's AOL private e-mail account.
