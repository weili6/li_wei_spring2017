There's a lot of people unhappy with the way Democrats have run the goverbment, get off your liberal high horse and realize that poor Americans who receive more federal subsidies than they pay in taxes get a vote too. Maybe if dems actually tried talking to these people we wouldn't have Trump in office. I say this as someone who supported 80 percent of what Obama did, I thought he was a class act. Too bad you guys are all busy playing identity politics to bring Americans from all states together. Since I know I'm going to get attacked as someone who supports racism, misogyny, etc... let me just say that I am an asian immigrant- legal mind you. I actually spent the time and resources to obey the law. Dems are losing a lot of Asian voters, I don't care what the polls say, most of my Asian friends around 30 years of age voted Trump. Precisely because of the arrogance liberals display every day in condemning anyone who doesn't agree with them to a T. Also because even a newspaper as left leaning as NYT gets attacked fir publishing an opinion piece from the opposing side.
