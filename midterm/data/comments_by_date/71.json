Is that right?  George Soros \"rented a mob\" of an estimated half-million people---to descend on the National Mall to protest the person and policies of Donald Trump?  Is that right?<br/><br/>And the protests---large and small---occurring in large and small cities and towns across the country were funded by George Soros?  Is that right?<br/><br/>Because it's just inconceivable to you that so many people would so dislike and distrust and have such disdain for Donald Trump---his person and his policies---that they would, of their own accord, show up to protest?  Is that right?<br/><br/>You not only demean those who prefer something other than a narcissistic, pathological liar as president, you underestimate the strength of their convictions.  One can only hope that you and your ilk will continue to underestimate the power of those who protested/protest.  And will continue to delude yourselves with the idea that George Soros is able to mobilize such concentrated strength/power.<br/><br/>Given the history of your tribe, I suspect my hopes will be realized.  If it is, we can, perhaps by the end of 2020, finally get rid of you and others like you who just can't stand the thought of sharing a piece of the (white) privilege pie with people who, well, aren't like you and don't want to be.
