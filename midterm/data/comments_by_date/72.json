It's too hard for Republican Congressmen to deal with sick people, poor people, the air and water we all share, the public schools and colleges that educate all our workers. Make the states do it. Oh, and make THEM raise THEIR taxes because Washington Republicans are too cowardly to tell their gazillionaire cronies and donors to pay a few more dollars. States have to balance their budgets so it's either cut services and programs or raise taxes. And when a state, city, county or school district doesn't have much of tax base, raising taxes is a non-starter, so they just circle the drain. Or beg Congress for grants to save them. Republican governors no less than Democrats are always making trips to Washington to get some pork for their barrels back home.
