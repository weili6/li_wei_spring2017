Just because a loser protests the winner doesn't mean the loser's vote should have a mulligan.   If the protesters were the ones who voted for the winner, they should not be ignored.  But that is not the case here, all the protesters are the voters who voted for the loser, and they don't get a do over.  Representatives do well to not act on protests from the losers.

In the end, our founding fathers collectively sought to make this country as strong as was possible to protect the nation from invasion and dissolution by uniting the states under a centralized federal government - so as to preserve this country as a haven for freedom and democracy in this world. That is how this nation was formed.  <br/><br/>In truth, Walker only wishes to decentralize this country now because he and his party are in control of the State of Wisconsin. He wishes to seize this opportunity to return government control to himself as Governor, in complete opposition to the Founders intent. To be free as ruler to undermine democratic opposition and liberate moneyed benefactors to give money freely so that government and laws may be shaped to their wishes and they be allowed to monopolize and pollute at will.   And so Walker himself may be free to be enriched and pursue happiness in a manner deserved by a man of his office and station.  To hell with the rest of you all.  Winners rule, that's why losers are losers.  Takers - Take a hike! <br/><br/>We have morphed from a nation built by Founding Fathers to a nation controlled by Funding Fathers.  Walker is a complete anathema to the core foundations of this nation and intents of our forefathers. Scott - you are the supreme taker.
