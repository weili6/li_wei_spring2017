A year later after the victory in China, those forces were back in Korea, highly trained and experienced. Dean Atchinson had recently given a speech in Japan saying the United States interest in Asia didn't extend past the Strait of Korea between Japan and Korea - a clear mistake on his part (he also did a mistake that triggered Japan to choose to decide to bomb Pearl Harbor). Kim decided that that meant that the U.S. would not bother defending South Korea. So with Mao in debt to Kim, Kim sought and got approval from Stalin to attempt to invade the south. Citing Atcheson's speach he aquiesced (after having turned Kim down several times before). Kim was correct  in assessing his experienced and well trained forces created a power inbalance in his  favor in 1950. He invaded the South in June 1950 and quickly overran front line forces, and Seoul, and the coordinated efforts of  the North Korean army was so good that they easily overcame the first American units that they faced as well.
