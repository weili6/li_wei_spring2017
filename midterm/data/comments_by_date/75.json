Essentially, economically we gave away access to our very rich markets in exchange for geopolitical hegemony over this vast alliance. Many of these  nations, regions, protected their own economies  even while  they were dumping vast tons of trade into the U.S. The U.S. policy makers figured that because the U.S. was more advanced and competitive, it could give up some ground to these countries in more traditional sectors in exchange for penetration in advance sectors. Some times this hurt, as with autos with Japan and S. Korea, some times it worked out well, as in the 1990s and the export of computers and software. NATO and the other alliances basically put the militaries of the 25 of the 30 or so richest countries of the world's military at our disposal for the almost token price of reasonable/rational diplomacy.
