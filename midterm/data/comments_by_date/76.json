That\u2019s because President Trump, by not releasing his tax returns, has become, by far, the least transparent President in the history of our country.<br/><br/>Maybe the Senate Democrats could strike a deal: Release your tax returns, and we will \u201cadvise and consent\u201d your Supreme Court nomination. I would never agree to that, after what the Republican Senators did to Obama and the Constitution.
