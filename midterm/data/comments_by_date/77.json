But Sessions walked back his denial by claiming he was \"just confused\". That's what we need - a \"confused\" Attorney General.

And remembering the excruciatingly long Congressional investigations into Benghazi, surely there should be investigations about Russia's ties to our 45th President.  'Connecting the dots' and  'crossing the Ts and dotting the Is' are stupid memes.  But in the case of our President's strange ties to Putin's Russia, we the people need to know what was going on as Russia despoiled America's 2017 Preidential Election and threw a last minute Comey/FBI  monkey wrench into Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign.

You have been a shining role model of someone who nurtures and treasures a long-term relationship. You did good. And on top of that: I can see your adventurous soul, your delight in spontaneity. And beyond that: I have loved your works for so long, and have been so nourished by your words. I am sorry you have to leave so early, but am glad that you get to leave so much.
