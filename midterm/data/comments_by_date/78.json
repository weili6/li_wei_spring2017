Obama and the US military did take actions to slow the development of the North Korean nuclear missile program.  The point the article makes however is that there are limited options short of a preemptive risky US military strike or invasion that could stop the North Korean progress to reach their goal .  Such a military action would probably cause retaliation by China who by the way do have lots of nuclear ICBM's that would strike the US and as the article points out the US anti missile  system costing $300 BILLION will not protect us.<br/>Trump is inheriting this situation and will now learn that boastful statements like \"it won't happen\" and idle threats of military strikes you suggest should be employed  are silly, harmful and don't do anything to manage or solve the problem.", "trusted": 0, "userDisplayName": "P Lock", "status": "approved", "recommendedFlag": 0, "userID": 65537809, "commentType": "userReply", "replies": [], "userTitle": "NULL", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "albany,ny"}]}, "userID": 61748246, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 330, "createDate": "1488636069", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-program-sabotage.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21683256, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488636242", "approveDate": "1488636242", "parentID": null, "rgt": 1667, "replyCount": 1, "userLocation": "Bloomington, Indiana", "commentSequence": 21683256, "commentBody": "Amy, I completely understand.  I was diagnosed wish the same thing ten years ago.  Stage 3C.  I'm still here.  I've had one remission in 2014.  I'm great, unless i\"m dead.  The reality is I live from 3mo check up to 3mo.  My CA125 is very \"predictive.\"  I asked my doctor the last time why have I done so well.  He said some women respond really well to treatment and it can be almost a chronic condition.  He thinks I'm one.  Who knows.  Maybe you will be, too.  So don't give up.<br/> My husband is and has been the  most amazing partner in this saga.  The first time I had a list of women who would have been great partners when I'm gone. Only because before me (30 years ago at that time)  I thought his taste in women left a lot to be desired.  After I finished treatment, we left NY to move to a slower paced university town.  Such a great move.  When I told him about the list, he thought it was funny, but really didn't appreciate my candidates.<br/> But now, ten years later,  I find myself trying to organize things so my husband can jump in and seamlessly handle the things I do.  I'm the money manager.  And, I've organized as much as I can so that he'll be OK when I'm gone.  This is just what you do for someone you love beyond measure.

Most importantly, although I have nothing to prove it, I truly believe that my mother encouraged my father to not stay alone and to be open to new people in his life. My sister, Julie, and I cared for my father after my mother passed, and his close circle of friends provided wonderful support, but he was alone in his heart.
