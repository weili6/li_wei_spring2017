In \"Through the Eye of the Needle,\" the historian Peter Brown's brilliant study of the changing attitudes toward wealth during the early Roman Empire, it's clear the early Christians understood the poor and the outcast as a special category of human existence that spiritually haunted those of who are not poor,. More, they believed giving to the poor was the only way for those with any wealth at all to reach God. After all, Jesus had explicitly said that it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle [the small entry camels had to bend down and crawl through that was next to a city's gate] than for a rich man to get to heaven. <br/><br/>One of the most vigorous debates among these early Christians, then, devolved into whether getting to heaven required direct almsgiving, or whether giving indirectly, by supporting the many monasteries whose monks had deliberately chosen to be poor, reached God equally well. <br/><br/>My husband and I are not Christian, and in fact, are not religious at all. We do not see ourselves as trying to wangle anything from God; rather, out of some vague and unexamined sense of obligation that we simply must \"give back\" some of our (modest) wealth, we give regularly, with no discussion at all, to a rescue mission in LA and another here in NY.  <br/><br/>What Francis drives home for me is that while what we do may be commendable, it's a far cry from what Christianity asks of Christians.
