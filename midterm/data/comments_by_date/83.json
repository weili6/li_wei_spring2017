One thing I've learned by living among different types of people.  The reality of people's lives are very complex and one's initial interpretation of another's life is usually far off the mark.  What this guy told the journalist - and then what this journalist heard - may not really get at the true issue.  Often people convince themselves that they are where they're at out of choice, i.e. he didn't quit, but was 'quited'.<br/>Sometime the socioeconomic situation speaks for itself.  Look at the physical condition of many Trump supporters.  They are clearly causalities.  I think it was Studs Terkel who said he always gave money regardless of what he thought a bum might do with it, because at least he knew 100% of his gift would reach its target.<br/>I voted for Trump to help protect a true, grass-roots democratic movement against a truly undemocratic attack by the establishment.  This was very hard, as he is revolting.  I also believe that the LONG-TERM prognosis for progressive politics in America would have been WORSE if Hillary got in.
