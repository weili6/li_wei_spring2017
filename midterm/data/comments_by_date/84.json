Will building a \"Wall\", a worthless expenditure of public monies, improve their lives or create jobs?  No.  Will it improve their children's education? No.   <br/><br/>Are we to feel sorry for these men who benefit from union membership, earning salaries placing them well into the middle class.  As union members they receive mostly paid up health  insurance, pension, and savings plans, now and when they retire, something only a tiny number of American workers receive.  All the evidence is that immigration creates jobs not cost jobs. Trump is more likely to diminish union influence than protect or enhance it, so how is that support better lives for workers.  Wake up.<br/><br/>Trump has no idea what actions to take to improve them these brothers' lives.  He's never struggled.  Will Trump force companies who receive tax benefits to create additional new jobs from their profits? Don't kid me.<br/><br/>Finally, this attitude,\"I'll buy American products until I have to pay more\", is a free riding and dependency attitude of \"let someone else do the heavy lifting\", affirming to companies they are smart to produce consumer goods abroad.
