As a practical manner, some of us encounter this situation so often, it really is not in our budget to give to everyone. I think  the Pope's advice to just give provides clarity for those who wrestle with the ideas that their gift is going to perpetuate their alcohol or drug abuse.

Giving money directly to the homeless is the fastest way to alleviate suffering.  Giving money to organizations that help the homeless may not in fact do anything for individual homeless people.  Many hopeless are so afraid of rape or exploitation at shelters that they won't even go to them.  Many shelter staff take donations, and the homeless never see them.  These staff feel it is their \"right\" since they are often poorly compensated for what they do.<br/><br/>That said, male panhandlers make a lot more money from random charity than female panhandlers do.  If you are going to give money on the street, make sure you also give to females.  As someone who was homeless (and female) I know this firsthand.<br/><br/>If you want to really help individual homeless people, consider giving 20.00 gift cards to a general store like Target, and insist that the shelter you give them to has each homeless resident sign off on having received them.  This will minimize the chances of the money being spent on alcohol or drugs, and still allow each homeless person some choice to buy what he or she needs most.", "userDisplayName": "Monica Miller", "assetID": 3466331, "recommendationCount": 1, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 75146415, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "userReply", "lft": 243, "createDate": "1488631915", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/the-pope-on-panhandling-give-without-worry.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21682679, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488637357", "approveDate": "1488637357", "parentID": null, "rgt": 427, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Independence KY", "commentSequence": 21682679, "commentBody": "This Pope is one interesting guy and has changed my decades-long position on this matter.
