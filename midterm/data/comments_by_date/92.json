It is a crime to \u201cknowingly\u201d lie, or worse, commit perjury in testimony before Congress.  Also Trump campaign advisor, Roger Stone, had direct contact with WikiLeaks Julian Assange and tweeted before the WikiLeak dumps of Hillary Clinton that her presidential campaign would be ruined by this illegal hacking information of the DNC.  This proves the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government, whom USA intelligence has disclosed illegally obtained information &amp; provided to WikiLeaks could potentially have undermined Clinton's presidential chances.  Also, Wilbur Ross directed the<br/>Russian Commercial Bank of Cyprus which the Panama Papers expose revealed was used by Putin and his circle of billionaire oligarchs to launder large amounts of illegally obtained Russian money.  Reuters is doing an in depth investigation of this criminal activity.  The Guardian showed how Putin used this bank as well as other off shore financial entities to become the richest man in the world which Trump obviously admires &amp; emulates.
