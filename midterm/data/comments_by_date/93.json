I did recall that the very same pocket that held my Onyx ring was over burdened by hastily gathered coins from home.<br/>Full of my self, as youth often is, I passed a pandhandler on Waverly Place, remembering the coins, I plunged my right hand into that pocket and gave the beggar all the money and, unknowingly, a very costly black onyx ring.<br/><br/>A few blocks later I said \"Oh!,The Ring!\" I got a wry smile on my face, and was glad I had an opportunity to be genorous to one who needed it more than I did.  <br/><br/>Good experience?

Last winter in Miami I packed an extra lunch of fruits and vegetables, hummus and nuts and raisins and gave it to a very sweet homeless woman in poor health (her legs were very swollen, she had trouble walking) who hung out at Starbucks, where I worked daily on my computer.  As a woman I felt comfortable doing this.  She didn't smoke or drink that I could tell.  She just read her bible everyday and tried to sleep.  Occasionally I bought her a sandwich as well and a few times I gave her a little cash.  After a couple of months of bringing her healthy food (I told her it was like medicine - very healing - and she ate it.)  After a couple of months the police finally told her she had to leave or go to jail, as the manager had complained).  Fortunately a church group did step in to help her.  They drove her back to Starbucks not long afterwards and she got out of the car to give me a gift, in a little brown paper bag.  It was a small wooden cross she had painted herself with a little red cross in the center of it.  I gave her a big hug, a little cash and my phone number.  She said she would always remember me.  I will always remember her as well, as a very sweet person.  I helped her because I just can't stand to see people hungry.  It really upsets me.
