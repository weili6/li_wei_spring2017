Telling someone to go away and come back is akin to saying they should go run a marathon.When you are sleeping on the ground and haven't eaten in a few days, then having to muster up the energy to get to someplace you think could help is one of the most difficult experiences anyone can have.<br/><br/>So, if your change or one dollar bill goes to something you may not approve of, what difference does that make in your life? If you gave it away it very well could mean the difference between life and death for the person on the receiving end.", "userDisplayName": "Crystal", "assetID": 3466331, "recommendationCount": 4, "status": "approved", "replies": [], "userID": 63760997, "statusID": 2, "userTitle": "NULL", "commentType": "comment", "lft": 548, "createDate": "1488614393", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "assetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/opinion/the-pope-on-panhandling-give-without-worry.html", "userURL": "NULL"}, {"commentID": 21681398, "editorsSelection": 0, "updateDate": "1488638051", "approveDate": "1488638051", "parentID": null, "rgt": 551, "replyCount": 0, "userLocation": "Seattle", "commentSequence": 21681398, "commentBody": "A moral lecture on giving from one of the richest institutions in the world.
