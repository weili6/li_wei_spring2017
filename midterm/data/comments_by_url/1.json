So let's be clear: Trump isn't an innocent bystander in this mess. Rather, he's the one who invited the Russians--on national television and on a high-profile social media platform--to interfere with our political process. Trump's cast of sycophants described the comment as a \"joke.\" Is anyone laughing? I'm not laughing. Yelling \"bomb!\" in an airport will get you arrested, regardless of whether it was intended as a joke. In other words, it's not about intent, it's about consequences.

America thought it was done, but it isn't.  Our thinking that the Cold War was a historical relic has made us fat, complacent and lazy in geo-politics.  <br/><br/>Trump and his ilk's treasonous acts are the vectors used in conducting the attack.  America needs to wake up and realize we're in a new Cold War folks, and it has heated up out there in Cyberspace.  If we don't recognize its nature and stop acting like the complacent Empire we have become then we will be paying for it into the far future.  And we will deserve all that we get.
