They did not ask him if he simply met with any russians, which as we alllll know, is at times a regular part of the job on the senate foreign relations committee to meet with foreign ambassadors. and so everyone knows, one of those times was in sessions washington office for gods sake where no one in their right mind would hold any sort of nefarious meeting such that the dems are alleging, and the other meeting  involved a group of ambassadors after a Heritage Foundation event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. Kislyak was part of a \u201csmall group\u201d of diplomats who approached Sessions and spoke with him, which again, is NOT somewhere anything nefarious is going to take place IF it was at all.    <br/><br/>What the times and the dems TOGETHER are doing is HIGHLY disingenuous.
