As Pelosi, Hillary and Soros stir the Calderon of hate so it splashes in the fires of hate they chant their evil songs. Instead of helping America they and media hate America and the good citizens of America and want to replace them all with the third world trash they can manipulate.

Rather than join POTUS-BHO, McConnell defaulted to his eight-year long position of disrespecting the sitting, convincingly elected president, twice, and threatened him. McConnell stated that, if POTUS-BHO went ahead with releasing the information without McConnell, the senator would claim that he was attempting to sway the election in favor of Hillary. POTUS-BHO backed off.<br/><br/>For GOP AND DJT's supporters to claim that POTUS-BHO is trying to undermine DJT (who is doing a superb job of undermining himself with the corruption that is evident in such a short span of time) is ludicrous, and hypocritical, considering McConnell's threat in hiding Russian involvement and Comey's presence in that meeting. All of this has been reported.<br/><br/>POTUS-BHO's officials did what was necessary, considering the corruption in the WH and the  attempted cover up by GOP lawmakers. Shameful.
