Mr. Sessions was approached once at the end of a speech by a group of diplomats who thanked him for his presentation and his attendance, among this group was the Russian ambassador, with no other interaction and the second meeting was with the Russian ambassador while Senator Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee and this was an official contact with no discussion about the election or campaign.<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>The nature of the contacts remains unknown. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates have done business in Russia, and it is unclear if any of the contacts were related to business dealings.<br/><br/>The New York Times, citing four current and former officials, reported last month that the American authorities had obtained information of repeated contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and senior Russian intelligence officials. The White House has dismissed the story as false.<br/><br/>Since the Feb. 14 article  appeared, more than a half-dozen officials have confirmed contacts of various kinds between Russians and Trump associates.
