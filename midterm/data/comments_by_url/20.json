Power under restraint takes immense discipline and patience especially when your reputation, accomplishments and legacy are being slandered. Obama White House was shrewd and deliberate, quietly preserving intel so that we could get Flynn,Sessions, Trump etc. denials on record.  It took down Flynn, and now maybe Sessions too, and we can only hope Trump. This steady drum beat also serves to keep Trump WH on defensive, distracted and irritated. As it is they cannot get any traction; signatures on executive orders are just smoke and mirrors for his faithful.<br/><br/>Listen - Trump supporters don't care now - they voted for him and to denounce him now would mean they take responsibility for the destruction and peril of the US he will cause. But this will change when they personally experience their healthcare being taken away, and understand that their job lost is not coming back due to automation and modernization, and start paying more for retail and food because of import taxes and loss of immigrant workers.
