Then you have Rex Tillerson, Roger Stone (ex-Watergate), Steve Bannon, Steve Miller, Michael Flynn. And now, billionaire Wilbur Ross, new Commerce Secretary, turns out to be director of a Cyprus bank that launders money for Russian oligarchs. More frightening still is Trump\u2019s weak support for NATO and the European Union, two institutions that Putin so desperately wants to undermine because they are obstacles to Putin\u2019s vision to reestablish a Soviet Empire. Clearly, Trump would have rescinded the sanctions if there were not the attention focused on it.
