These guys could probably even plant misleading leads to foreign domains so as to cover their footprints and shift the blame to others.

This is obviously taken for granted by most, so nobody demands presentation of any evidence as to how they did it. If, on the other hand, dozens of NSA \"super users\" had the capabilities, we can be pretty sure that some among those digital wizards would have had sympathies for Trump and thus would have had the motive to hurt the Clinton campaign.
