Remember Obama's mocking retort to Romney during one of their debates,\"The 1980s called, they want their foreign policy back\"?  Remember the context of that retort?  It was Romney's assertions that Russia was our greatest geopolitical foe.  <br/><br/>Now after he was slow to grasp the Russian anti American efforts, Obama and his minions seek to spread a story that Trump is too friendly with the Russians, and the lap dogs in the media are chasing every stick thrown.  <br/><br/>Now wonder an outsider like Trump won the Presidency.  Americans are coming to grips with the failure of their political institutions and the Washington press, lo these past twenty years.", "permID": "21659779", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "userLocation": "Hopkinton NH", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userDisplayName": "Eric Glen", "status": "approved", "replyCount": 0, "createDate": "1488465293", "timespeople": 1, "trusted": 0, "recommendations": 1, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentType": "comment"}, {"recommendedFlag": null, "updateDate": "1488467896", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "sharing": 0, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "commentID": 21658303, "approveDate": "1488467896", "userID": 60866179, "replies": [], "depth": 1, "parentID": null, "commentSequence": 21658303, "editorsSelection": false, "commentBody": "It's striking how effective Campaign Trump was in lowering the bar for President Trump.<br/><br/>The prejudice, true-believer-ism, self-interest and party first mentality infecting this country at the moment are fearsome in their impact and frightening in their effects.<br/><br/>We have no idea whether Trump, his campaign, his agents, rogue Republicans out to seal a victory, or anyone had direct, purposeful contact with the Russians.<br/><br/>We have no idea why Comey suffered a mental and ethical breakdown manifest as unthinking antipathy for Democrats and absolute disregard for his mission, his oath, the credibility of his agency, or the truth of what he was saying.<br/><br/>We really have no clue at all about the exact moment when 'Republican'<br/>ceased to be a subset of 'American' and lit out on its own.<br/><br/>But we do have a clear picture that these things happened, that they had an important if not a deciding effect upon a Presidential Election, and that there is no one (CIA, FBI, Republicans, Democrats, House, Senate, Courts, Press) with the credibility to examine the situation and issue believable findings.<br/><br/>Worse, the American people seem fine with taking a quick peek and moving on.  <br/><br/>That there is no mechanism to explore what happened in the face of system wide corruption and self-dealing indicates how very far we have strayed from an authentic American vision.<br/><br/>The founders never even conceived of a candidate, a party, or a voting public bereft of all good sense and patriotism.
