First off nobody on the left thought Trump would win. Trump was worried about fraud and hacking and Obama told us all straight faced that there was no fear of Russia Hacking the elections. Then all of a sudden Trump wins by going to the right states like many before him and takes the electoral college from Hillary and Wins the presidency.  Now Obama's entire legacy is in danger because the new president elect has a totally different vision for America. Which gives Obama motive to lay a seed like this unproven Russian hacking theory that will hover over the new presidents presidency and make it harder for him to do the work he was elected to do.<br/><br/>The Russians hacked the DNC through Podestas emails and his password was \"password\" ? Come on people 4 Chan hackers claimed responsibility hours after the official wiki leaks release of these emails. This was not a hack because a hack imply's breaching security in which there was none. <br/><br/>There is about as much credibility to these claims as the one we are getting from the media right now. No facts, just hearsay from both liberal and conservatives. Until I see actual facts with provable NAMES no SOURCES. I will not for a minute believe these stories.

Meanwhile, the listener's head is spinning outta control, and he or she gets almost a classical migraine. <br/><br/>Again, it is highly enticing for anyone to that say a few of Trump's staff seem to revel in dissembling, especially when it comes to defending their derrieres, if Putin is in the picture. Whether there was Russian influence in altering the 2016 election results or not, remains to be proven, beyond any reasonable doubts. In addition, Sean Spicer castigates those trouble makers, and  apparently implies that all these are unfounded theories,  and had no bearing on the 2016 elections. <br/><br/>Anyone who relies on Spicer's innuendos, needs a head-shrink.
