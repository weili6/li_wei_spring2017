Why would a commander in chief tolerate the security risk for TWO WEEKS? Answer: Trump should have felt Flynn went behind his back, and fired him immediately, unless....None of those answers falls very far short of election tampering by cooperating/conspiring with a foreign (and hostile to US interests) nation in influencing the outcome to their (both parties') liking. So the questions Trump will avoid is what did he know, and when did he know it? Not much changes, including the outcome.  After Trump goes on the record on those issues (as far as I know, he hasn't been asked and given an unequivocal answer) it will start to unravel. Anyone who's read Shakespeare already knows that. Restriction of the press' ability to ask questions is an impairment of its freedom of speech and a denial of equal protection. It fits a fascist agenda. If it looks, acts, and talks like a fascist, guess what? It's not a duck.<br/>And we all know that when we see the so called President's tax returns, we'll find bodies (conflicts) galore.
