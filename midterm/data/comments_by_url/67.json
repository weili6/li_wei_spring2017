Hear about the sweet \"deal\" in which a Russian billionaire paid $100 million for an estate in Palm Beach which Trump had purchased a few years earlier for $40 million.  A deal that handed Trump a $60 million windfall at a moment when he was desperate for money and the Russian was moving as many millions/billions as possible out of Russia so his wife wouldn't get it in their messy divorce.   The money was moving through the Bank of Cyprus where Wilbur Ross, the new Secretary of Commerce, sits on the board and the CEO is the disgraced former CEO of Deutsche Bank which was fined millions by the US and Germany for laundering Russian money. After he was dumped by Deutsche Bank, he landed at Bank of Cyprus which is now doing the same thing.   The Russian connections in the Trump administration are many and run deep.  If Maddow could access all of this information -- so can the rest of the media and definitely the US intelligence agencies can and should be putting it all together and ultimately forcing Trump and his entire corrupt, ugly gang out of the government.
