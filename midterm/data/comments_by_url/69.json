The real goal had always been to hurt the legitimacy of Hillary Clinton and hamper her presidency. <br/><br/>The republicans should push for an investigation to clear Trump and move on. I'm sure the main reason they are stalling is because they fear that the same intelligence officials who are leaking information to hurt Trump will not give him a fair and unbiased investigation.", "permID": "21654716", "picURL": "https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png", "userLocation": "Seattle", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "userDisplayName": "jon", "status": "approved", "replyCount": 2, "createDate": "1488422475", "timespeople": 1, "trusted": 0, "recommendations": 11, "parentUserDisplayName": null, "commentType": "comment"}, {"recommendedFlag": null, "updateDate": "1488424023", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "sharing": 0, "reportAbuseFlag": null, "commentID": 21654635, "approveDate": "1488424023", "userID": 60253559, "replies": [], "depth": 1, "parentID": null, "commentSequence": 21654635, "editorsSelection": false, "commentBody": "As impossible as it is for most of us to believe that a president of this country could be allied with Russia, this latest information forces one to re-examine that belief.
