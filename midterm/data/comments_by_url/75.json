We (you and I) are seeing another attempt at Russian expansion in the world.  And with Trump, they have their boy.

Now, McConnell and Ryan have to deal with him to get their agendas through.<br/><br/>But right, it's whatever the Trump supporters in those swing states want.  If we support Russia in its effort to gain power in the world, then American democracy will yield to Russian totolitarianism.
